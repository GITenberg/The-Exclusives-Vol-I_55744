<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">THE BOUDOIR.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boudoir of a woman of fashion exhibits
in its history, if faithfully recorded, a
picture of the manners, modes, and morals of
the times; and, however little such things
in themselves might deserve to be handed
down, or registered as objects of imitation,
yet to chronicle them for the day would not
be without its use. The sensible part of
mankind would laugh at the follies, and wonder
at the extravagance, which the page of
such ephemeral history unfolded; while the
actors in the scene might possibly view in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
mirror held up to them their own lives, and
their own actions, in a new and truer light.</p>

<p>Lady Tilney's boudoir,&mdash;the boudoir <i>par
excellence</i>,&mdash;was not in fact a boudoir, according
to the old legitimate meaning of the word.
Indeed, Lady Tilney herself, the presiding
deity of the sanctuary, professed her contempt
of legitimacy in boudoirs, as well as in sovereigns;
at least she did so in words, though,
like many other professors, her words and
actions frequently contradicted each other;
and it may be questioned if there are any
greater despots, than those who inveigh most
against despotism.</p>

<p>But to return from this digression to the
boudoir. Lady Tilney's boudoir was destined
to the reception of far other votaries
than those of the old <i>rabattu</i> god of love.
No: her boudoir was visited by persons of a
very different character from those who were
formerly the frequenters of such a scene.
Authors, poets, political intriguers, artists,
and committees for the management of the
state of society, formed the chief personages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
among those who figured there, and their business
was of a very different complexion from
that of the supposed use, or original meaning
ascribed to a boudoir.</p>

<p>In the former, of old, the painted harpsichord,
the huge cabinet, the gigantic chimney-piece,
the tapestried wall, were suited to the
silken garb, and bag and sword, that formed
the attire of the male part of its visitants; as
well as to the hoop and fly-cap of the ladies
who presided there. In this modern temple
of idolatry, only a few of the ancient
decorations were allowed a place, such as the
marquetry cabinet, the <i>or-moulu</i> clock, or vase
of China; but for the rest, what a change!</p>

<p>Volumes of worth, and works of merit and
deep learning, were now covered by the novels
of the day, or hidden by trivial elegancies
newly imported from Paris; while on the
walls, the rare productions of Titian or Vandyck
were intermingled with some chalky
portrait of the modern school, tricked out in
the millinery geer of the fashion of the day.
Scattered on the tables, however, there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
redeeming feature in the character of the
decorative objects which met the eye, for
there lay some richly chased gold ornaments,
the works of Benvenuto Cellini, or some one
not less skilful, though it may be of forgotten
name; and while these ornamented the apartment,
they served the double purpose of
affording Lady Tilney an opportunity, not
only to discourse on their beauty, but to enter
into all the particulars of Cellini's strange
life.</p>

<p>Add to this description of the boudoir and
its visitants, the occasional presence of Lady
Tilney's beautiful children, and its portraiture
is closed; but not so the genius and history
of all the transactions, councils, and cabals
which took place there. These will be best
understood, by passing from the boudoir to
Lady Tilney's own character and pursuits;
if to describe these by any means were indeed
possible: but it would be an endless, hopeless
task, to enumerate all that Lady Tilney did,
or fancied <i>she did</i>&mdash;still more what she said;
for to do her justice, her's was no vapid existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the mere routine of a London lady's
life.</p>

<p>No&mdash;indolence was not the besetting sin,
insipidity was not the vice of her <i>morale</i> or her
<i>physique</i>. But as to enumerating severally the
subjects which employed her care, and the
various branches of these subjects into which
she diverged, that indeed would be difficult.
Her life and occupations may, perhaps, be
best delineated by representing them as one
vast bazar of interests, all equally claiming
her attention&mdash;"the court, the camp, the
senate, and the field:" certainly the field of
Newmarket, where it is said she regulated her
husband's calculations and interests with great
success.</p>

<p>These objects, and many more than these,
which, as the charlatans say at the end of their
lists, are too tedious to mention, filled up the
life of this laborious and distinguished lady.
Nor were her labours less onerous in managing
the government of the society of <i>ton</i>.
Her rule was there despotic&mdash;her word was
law;&mdash;and if some few persons pretended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
step aside, not following the fashionable multitude
in bowing the knee to Baal, or ventured
to think for themselves in the circle in which
she moved, immediately, as though by an
enchanter's wand, they were banished thence,
and some more amalgamating spirit was chosen
to fill up the vacancy. There was a kind of air-gun
fired, which was sure to hit the mark,
without betraying the hand that drew the
trigger: a sort of <i>lettre-de-cachet</i>, as effectual
as those promulgated in the times of Louis le
Grand, which consigned to oblivion the offending
persons, while the victims themselves could
not fathom any cause or assign any particular
reason for the sentence.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the very midst of this
ruling and reigning, this despotic sway in the
court of <i>ton</i>, a secret dissatisfaction existed in
the breast of Lady Tilney. She, indeed, was
one of those haughty liberals who affect to
despise kings and courts; not because they
dislike those necessary evils, as they call them,
but because they are themselves, or would be
if they could, the greatest of all sovereigns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding, therefore, the high ground
of rank and situation on which she stood, it
rankled at her heart to have offended her sovereign,
and to feel herself an object of just dislike
to him; for, however great the magnanimity
shewn to her on the occasion of her
offence, still to be aware that, under circumstances,
she could no longer be considered a
favourite at court, was in itself a source of the
deepest mortification. Impressed with this
consciousness, what was to be done? Why, render
all courts the subject of flippant raillery;
vote them and their sovereigns old-fashioned
bores; erect herself into a queen, and have a
court of her own. In truth, this plan agreed
better with her self-love than any other; because
sovereigns and courts, in as far as regards
the outward decorum of forms, regulate
and keep society in its proper course; whereas,
under the sham dynasty of <i>ton</i>, caprice bears
rule, and tyranny in its worst sense marks the
conduct of those who sit on its ephemeral
throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Connected with this system, the pride of ancestry
too was necessarily another subject of
ridicule with Lady Tilney, who thought that
those who, on such grounds, pretended to take
any lead in the world of fashion, had much
better retire to their castles, and there indulge
in dreams of their greatness.</p>

<p>Nor did Lady Tilney's thirst for power end
with her effort for universal dominion in matters
of <i>ton</i>&mdash;she had another ambition, that
of leading and controlling the political party
to which she had attached herself. Here, however,
her sway was more imaginary than real;
and often the long-headed politician, or crafty
diplomate, as they listened with apparent complacency
to her advice, allowed her words to
fall unheeded on their ear, or laughed at her
in secret. With the young and uninformed
aspirants in the career of political life, Lady
Tilney had, perhaps, more success; and many
a rising scion of a noble house has been known
to adopt, under the influence of her smiles,
and from a foolish vanity of being noticed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
her, a line of conduct quite at variance with
the wishes of their parents, and to the sacrifice
of their own best interests.</p>

<p>In this grasp at power, however successfully
achieved, Lady Tilney felt herself ill at ease&mdash;her
mind was continually harassed by reflections
on the tottering and uncertain tenure
of <i>ton</i>, and the possibility, nay, probability,
of some younger, newer person, climbing to
the envied seat which she then possessed. The
fear of a certain Duchess of Hermanton was
constantly before her imagination, as the embodied
object of her alarm; and she considered
it as a measure little short of self-preservation,
to secure her influence, if possible, on a still
firmer basis, by some decided act, or the invention
of some fresh folly. As to Almack's,
that circle of exclusiveness had been polluted;
its brief course was run, and its brightness on
the decline.</p>

<p>The more Lady Tilney reflected on the
subject, the more she became convinced of the
expediency of her intentions; and determined,
therefore, to mature her plan immediately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Having despatched her notes to the Comtesse
Leinsengen, Lady Tenderden, and Lady
Ellersby, she commanded that no one should
be admitted to her presence but themselves.</p>

<p>"Yet stay, Destouches," she added to the
page, as she issued her orders; "Prince Luttermanne
by all means, should he call." And
then, having given audience to three cooks,
four painters, two authors, an authoress, and
several milliners, she finished with advice to a
poet and a critique upon his work.</p>

<p>Lady Tilney, before the arrival of the personages
she had written to (for Lady Tilney
knew the value of intervals), arranged her list
of engagements; tossing some into the fire&mdash;with
the velocity of one well practised in the
weight, measure, and value of names; and examining
others of more importance. She determined
to mar all that might interfere with her
own views in society.&mdash;"Mrs. Annesly, truly
what a griffin! and the Countess of Delamere,
and Lady Melcombe!&mdash;but the Marchioness
of Borrowdale! that indeed requires attention."
Lady Tilney rang the bell&mdash;Destouches appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in a minute&mdash;the peculiar hasty touch of
call was known to the well-appointed page.
"Send Arquimbeaud here!" and the distinguished
Arquimbeaud soon obeyed the summons.
"I have determined to have a party,
Arquimbeaud, next Thursday; see that cards
are issued for that day, according to this list."</p>

<p>As he withdrew, Comtesse Leinsengen was
announced. The immense bonnet and deep
veil&mdash;the splendid cashmere and still long petticoats
(although they were generally worn
very much shortened), afforded a favourable
costume to the lady who now advanced; certain
defects were thus concealed, and imagination
might lend that delicacy of slimness and
form to the feet and ancles which pervaded the
rest of the person, but which did not characterize
those of the Comtesse.</p>

<p>The rapid volubility of the one lady, and
the sharp short sentences of the other, began
the conference. Lady Tilney placed the most
luxurious of all the luxurious chairs close to
the fire, pushed forward the screen, and with
the eagerness of apparent friendship, seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to wish to make her visitor quite at home: or,
as she expressed it, "deliciously comfortable."
"You have learned that word now, dear Comtesse,&mdash;indeed
you have adopted it; and there
is no one who understands the thing so perfectly
as yourself."</p>

<p>Midst all these courtesies and courtings the
Comtesse observed a sort of abstracted air,
though they were (and so far Lady Tilney was
sincere) things of course.</p>

<p>"My dear Comtesse, I am so glad we have
a minute alone, to discuss our plans. I have
many things of consequence to say to you; but
before I begin I must speak to you of that
horrible affair of poor Lady Mailing's; it is
quite impossible to support her any longer,
for you are aware her secret is publicly known.
So long as she was prudent, and observed appearances,
it was all very well; but <i>now</i> it will
be impossible for me to receive her. You know
I never did receive any body who placed themselves
in a similar situation&mdash;not even my own
relations; my character has always been <i>intacte</i>,
and I cannot <i>compromète</i> myself, though I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
am very sorry for poor Lady Mailing; and had
she only avoided this <i>esclandre</i>, and managed
her affair prudently, I would have stood by her
to the end; but as it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly not," interrupted the Comtesse;
"you must be conscious that every one
knows Lady Tilney's high reputation, and it
would never be supposed dat you would countenance
a belle passion; vraiment, quand on
est tellement dupe as to sacrifice sa position
dans le monde, to a man's vanity, or to be
playing de sentimentale at forty, it is quite
enough to make one sick, and she well deserves
to be vat you call blown. <i>Mais, de grâce</i>, do not
let us prose more about her&mdash;<i>vat sinifies?</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, very true, and then there are other
matters of so much greater consequence to consider.
Do you really think that this administration
will hold&mdash;you who are in all the
secrets?&mdash;positively you must tell me. I am
sure if that man (lowering her voice to a whisper)
is at the head of affairs, all must go wrong&mdash;poor
England! what will become of you?
But we will never allow that&mdash;shall we?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! trève de politiques, ma chere, si vous
m'aimez; it is a subject quite marital, and
therefore, you know, not at all in my way.
What I want to revolutionize, or rather to reform,
is your state of society."</p>

<p>"Precisely, my dear Comtesse, it is the very
subject on which I wished to talk to you, when
I wrote requesting to see you&mdash;you received
my note, did you not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but it is an affair on which we
hold such very different opinions. My maxim
is, se bien amuser d'après sa propre volonté&mdash;that
is what I want to do; and to tell you the
truth, I am ennuyé à la mort in your London
world&mdash;every thing is so stupid here! Vat
signify dat tiresome Almack, after all? It was
good enough at first, when it put people in
a passion, et pendant que se faisoit fureur;
but now that, somehow or oder, you liberales
admitted every petite demoiselle vid her red
elbows, and vulgar mama to take care of her,
it has lost all its character, and I positively intend
to withdraw my name. Besides, de lady
patronesses cannot even maintain a seat at de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
top of de room&mdash;de oder night I find Lady
Melcombe and her daughter perch up in my
seat; and though I walked over them and
stared them down, dey positively took no hint,
but sat still so comfortably vulgar it was quite
provoking. No, no, my dear, Almack's day is
finish and de thing must fall&mdash;so never stay by
a falling friend; when a person or a ting
begins to totter, leave it."</p>

<p>"Very true," rejoined Lady Tilney; "there
is much truth in what you advise (and she
looked very grave). But then, you know, my
dear Comtesse, you must consider the independence
of our constitution&mdash;which makes it
very difficult&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not to have a stupid society.&mdash;Agreed."</p>

<p>"But the great number of our nobility,"
rejoined Lady Tilney, "and the weight and
consequence of a still greater number of influential
members in the other house"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Renders all your pretences of a société
choisie mere pretence."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Comtesse, you have yourself
owned that my parties are select; and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
yourself, although in a public situation, contrive
to leave out those who do not suit your
purpose. After all, what can tend more to
the preservation of society?&mdash;than such impertinence"
was on Lady Tilney's tongue;
but she checked herself, and added with a
little cough that gave time for reflexion:
"What can tend more to the maintenance of
a société distinguée than the exercise of this
choice, made without reference to the rank or
situation of the parties, but merely dependent
on the voice of the few who are formed to lead?"</p>

<p>"Very true," rejoined the Comtesse Leinsengen,
"and if that system was properly upheld,
it is the only chance of not being <i>obsédé</i>
by vulgars;&mdash;but you do not act upon it
sufficiently. As to myself, I can no long bear
de whole ting; my health does not permit of
your late hours, and I generally go away
when your company are beginning to arrive.
And then these great routs of your Duchess
D'Hermantons and your Ladi Borrowdales and
Aveling, sont à dormir de bout."</p>

<p>"Agreed, my dear Comtesse, I do so agree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
with you; it is the very matter I am longing
to discuss with you. Do let us settle something
amongst ourselves, that shall rid us of all these
evils, and establish a <i>société à part</i>. I must
tell you what I have already done to effect this
purpose. You know that odious Lady Borrowdale
has one of her everlasting At Homes next
Thursday, to meet their Royal Highnesses the
---- as usual, that vulgar decoy; so I have
therefore countermanded my former invitations,
and issued my cards for that very day&mdash;Nobody
will go there, will they?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not many; and if some do, there
are plenty left."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lady Tilney, with ill-concealed
anxiety, "but you know the royalties always
do accept her invitations."</p>

<p>"What matters dat&mdash;you do not care for
royalties." For an instant Lady Tilney's command
of language was checked&mdash;she almost
betrayed her vexation, when fortunately the
name of Lady Ellersby was announced, whose
dawdling drawl, as she entered the apartment,
smoothed over the asperities which began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mark the conversation, and which might have
rendered it in the end a little too <i>piquante</i>.</p>

<p>"My dear Lady Ellersby," said Lady Tilney,
"how charmed I am to see you. I was
dying to meet you, to consult you, to enjoy
your entertaining society." The Comtesse
Leinsengen smiled significantly, as she said,
"And so was I."</p>

<p>"Consult me! La&mdash;well, that is something
quite new&mdash;nobody ever consulted me; but
pray explain what you mean."</p>

<p>"Oh! we want to establish some regulations
by which our society shall be distinguished,
and which shall save us from the
inroads of all these people whom we are constantly
meeting, and obliged to be civil to,
whether we will or no&mdash;in short, something
that shall make us, as we ought to be&mdash;a <i>race
à part</i>."</p>

<p>"I thought," Lady Ellersby replied, "we
always were that."&mdash;"To be sure we were; but
then, my dear, you know abuses will creep in,
and all constitutions require from time to time
to be strengthened or reformed, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
circumstances; and you know, my dear Lady
Ellersby, that we have all of us long since
lamented that Almack's, which was excellent
in its way, has now, from the infringement on
its privileges, become quite corrupted from its
original design, and something positively must
be done, or we shall be overwhelmed <i>en masse</i>&mdash;something
to stem this torrent, this inroad
of Goths and Vandals."</p>

<p>"Dear me, that sounds very alarming&mdash;you
quite frighten me; I don' t understand you&mdash;pray
tell me what it is you propose."</p>

<p>"Why," answered Lady Tilney, "we wish to
form a society entirely to ourselves, which shall
be quite exclusive&mdash;a society for which we shall
settle <i>d'avance</i> every particular and qualification
of the persons who may be admitted to it.
Thus you see (turning to the Comtesse Leinsengen),
my dear Comtesse, we shall never do any
thing but in concert with each other, and
never invite any one but those who entirely
suit us. You understand me now, don't you?"
addressing Lady Ellersby.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, yes! I think I do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, you do not understand her. Permettez&mdash;in
one word I will explain vat Lady
Tilney mean to say: voici le mot de l'énigme&mdash;you
are all English, and though you do your
<i>possible</i> you cannot help being English. You
are all afraid in dis country to do vat you like
best; and though Lady Tilney propose to ask
only de chosen few, you will none of you do so
in reality, take my word for dat. You talk freedom,
but act in chains. Now we, au contraire,
<i>chez nous</i>&mdash;we women I mean&mdash;do de freedom,
and never tink of de chain at all; but whenever
you ladies make your lists for your parties
for instance; den comes&mdash;dis is not politic,
<i>toder</i> is not right,&mdash;dis is not my husband's
pleasure; some scarecrow or anoder is always
driving you off de land of amusement. Now
you say you will open your doors only to
those you like, and you are right&mdash;dere is no
oder secret for to make pleasant society; but
you will <i>not</i> do it nevertheless, ladies, for you
are all de cowards."</p>

<p>"Indeed, my dear Comtesse," rejoined Lady
Tilney, "you will find that we <i>shall</i>, though&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
I think effectually; although there are certain
principles in our constitution which extend
to the ruling even of private life&mdash;and these
the wives of certain nobles cannot wholly overlook."
Comtesse Leinsengen shrugged her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear, it is as I thought, you are de
woman I like best in dis country; but you are
all over shackle, up to de ear in de <i>qu'en dira
t'on</i>! De plebe ought to be made of de noble's
opinion, not de noble constrained to dat of de
vulgar."</p>

<p>"That may do very well with you," rejoined
Lady Tilney, "but with us as an unqualified
maxim it will never do. I grant, Comtesse,
all that you say can be done in one's own
house, where one makes one's own laws and
rules in one's own way: so far it is only asserting
one's own right to liberty, and as far as
we can persuade people to be of the same way
of thinking it is all right. But I have too much
liberty in my heart to desire to tyrannize as
you suggest; and, in fine, confess myself too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
much of an Englishwoman to wish to see
your system prevailing amongst us."</p>

<p>Lady Tilney said this in a tone of English
pride, which proved that she had not forgotten
all that was best worth remembering, although
it was in contradiction to the spirit of what
had fallen from her a moment before.</p>

<p>Lady Tilney, however, dealt largely in contradiction
at all times. The Countess Ellersby
smiled; the Comtesse Leinsengen again
shrugged her shoulders, drew her shawl around
her, and was preparing to depart, saying,
"Well! mes chères dames, I leave you to
the enjoyment of your liberty, and have
done."</p>

<p>"But I have not done," said Lady Tilney;
"I am determined we shall have a society that
shall be quite our own, and yet not subversive
of principles we must uphold. (Another
shrug of the shoulders.) Allow me to say, that
if you, Comtesse, and you, my dear Lady
Ellersby, will but second me, I am sure we
shall not fail, and I know I may reckon on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Prince Luttermanne co-operating with us;&mdash;so
far so good."</p>

<p>"And Princesse Luttermanne?" inquired
Lady Ellersby.</p>

<p>"Oh, for the prince's sake we must have
her," replied the Comtesse Leinsengen, "D'ailleurs,
<i>dans ma position</i>, it could not be oderwise&mdash;in
all cases we must pass over des inconveniens&mdash;besides
she is good-humoured, and has
<i>her own fry to fish</i>, and will not trouble us
much."</p>

<p>Lady Ellersby and Lady Tilney looked at
each other, and laughed. "And then," observed
Lady Tilney, "we have Princesse de la
Grange, and Mrs. Kirchoffer; we must enrol
them on our list (although they are sufficiently
insipid), because they can be useful, and dare
not act but in subserviency to <i>us</i>. But, Lady
Boileau, what shall we do with her? She indeed
has a will of her own, and she has a mother
very much <i>de trop</i>, whom however she
treats cavalierly enough (of which, by the way,
I do not approve); but, notwithstanding, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
think we must have her, though we can by no
means be troubled with the mama."</p>

<p>"Certainment pas," cried the Comtesse, "for
the Irish mama with her vulgar repartee would
give a mauvaise tournure to de whole society."</p>

<p>"There you are right; and while we admit
the daughter, remember, it is only on
sufferance, just on the same footing as we
admit Mrs. Kirchoffer, and as I propose that
we should also do Lady de Chere and Lady
Hamlet Vernon, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mais, que faire de la jeune lady," interrupted
the Comtesse, "qui parmi un certain
set is a good deal de vogue, Ladi&mdash;Ladi,&mdash;vat
you name her?"</p>

<p>"What, Lady Baskerville?" asked Lady
Tilney; and then replied, "Oh she must be
one of us, to be sure, for I think we can
make use of her&mdash;she only longs to be in the
fashion, and her husband also. Flatter their
vanity, and you do with them what you chuse;
make them believe they are of the <i>ton</i>, and
you have them at command."</p>

<p>"Well, den, now you have named all de
ladies I suppose, and dere is but one cavalier;
do you mean us to be a convent, and
have no gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"By no means, my dear Comtesse; of
course there will be all our husbands." Here
the Comtesse Leinsengen had recourse to her
usual expressive gesture of contempt. "And
then," proceeded Lady Tilney, "there is
the Duke of Mercington, Lord Raynham,
Lord Tonnerre, Leslie Winyard, and Frank
Ombre,&mdash;Spencer Newcombe,&mdash;and we must
not forget Lord Glenmore; though I wish
he were more decided in his political creed.
Besides we cannot omit Lord Albert D'Esterre,
whom we must have on probation, for
he is young and only just returned from
the Continent; but they say he is very
clever, and I think may in time become one
of us. But, ere we decide further on the
gentlemen, we must consult Prince Luttermanne."</p>

<p>"Ah! bon chere ladi" (with a nod of
approval). "Quite so," added Lady Ellersby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a><br /><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
languidly; "for, though he is called good-humoured,
he can be as cross as is necessary.
I never saw any body <i>walk over people</i> better
than he does."</p>

<p>Lady Tilney, who had been for the last
minute or two busily employed with her pen
setting down the names which she had just
mentioned, interrupted Lady Ellersby, saying,
"By the bye, there is one rule very
necessary to be observed, which I am sure
we shall all agree in; that is, to admit no
unmarried ladies, unless something very particular
indeed should make us waive our resolve.
When I say this, I do not, of course,
mean to <i>balls</i>; but I mean to those coteries
which will in fact constitute the élite of our
society. And then I propose that we none
of us go to the old-established dullifications;
but, on their nights, each one of us must in
turn take care to chuse that same evening for
our coteries."</p>

<p>"Dat vill do very well for de Lady Borrowdale,
and de Lady Aveling, and dat old Marchioness&mdash;vat
you call her&mdash;Feuille morte; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
La Duchesse D'Hermanton, vat vill you do
vid her? it is not so easy to <i>take dat lionne par
la barbe</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh," rejoined Lady Tilney, for this was
a name she feared to offend, "the Duchess
is not one of us, it is true; but we need
only walk once a year through her apartments;
and we can bear that&mdash;besides, she is a
sort of person" (apart)&mdash;and Lady Tilney
broke off abruptly from a subject, in itself
always disagreeable to her.</p>

<p>"And now," she went on to say, "having
formed the outline of our plan, we have only to
follow it up, and I am sure it will be successful.
I wonder Prince Luttermanne and Lady Tenderden
are not come, for I wrote to them both;
and I should have liked that we talked the
matter over altogether. However, I cannot
doubt but they will agree with us in our arrangements;
and if you, dear Comtesse, and
you Lady Ellersby, will see Princesse de la
Grange and Mrs. Kirchoffer, and Lady Baskerville,
I will take care to speak to the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
parties. Of course I shall see Prince Luttermanne
some time or other this day, and Lady
Tenderden, for they must have received my
notes; and I will settle with him about our
gentlemen." Then addressing the Comtesse,
she added, "I need not, I am sure, remind
you, who are so discreet, that the success of
every thing which is to produce éclat depends
upon the secret combination of the movements;
and therefore, in speaking to the different
parties, pray impress on their minds the
absolute necessity of privacy, and not to let our
designs be known beforehand by a premature
publication of them, but rather let them be
developed by their effect; and when their existence
will have been confirmed beyond the
possibility of counteraction."</p>

<p>"Assurement laissez moi faire."&mdash;And here
Lady Ellersby, looking at her watch, started
from her chair, saying, "Dear me! I had no
notion it was so late. I had an appointment
with my Lord, and it is past the time. Bless
me! what shall I do?" Then making her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
adieu, with more vivacity than was her custom,
she departed in greater haste than she was
ever known to do before.</p>

<p>"Who <i>is her</i> Milord just now?" asked
Comtesse Leinsengen.</p>

<p>"Oh fie! malicieuse," replied Lady Tilney.</p>

<p>"Is it again dat little consequential personage
who looks like a perdrix santé aux
truffes? I fancy I saw something like a réchauffé
getting up between them de oder night
at Lady De Chere's."</p>

<p>"Now really, my dear Comtesse, I must
defend my friend. People are always so ill-natured&mdash;one
must have some cavalier, you
know, to walk about with in public&mdash;and scandal
always ascribes evil where none exists. No,
no; Lady Ellersby has too charming a husband
for this to gain credit for a moment." The
Comtesse's usual shrug implied comme vous
voulez, and she added, "it is truly extraordinary
how any body can call dat ladi handsome,
vid her drawn mouth and peevish expression!"</p>

<p>"Surely she has a sweet smile?"&mdash;"When it is
not a bitter one," rejoined the Comtesse; "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
what <i>sinifies</i>? she does very well for what she
is good for. Now I must go, and you must be
de active agent in settling our Lady Parliament;
as for me, I will have a sinecure post."</p>

<p>"You are quite delightful, Comtesse, and
ought to have every thing your own way; so
good bye, if you <i>must</i> go. I will remember to
see Prince Luttermanne; I will not let the
matter rest&mdash;adieu," and they kissed each
other's cheeks on both sides, "adieu!"&mdash;"You
will not let de matter rest&mdash;no, I am sure you
will not&mdash;nor any oder ting or person," thought
the Comtesse, as she glided out of the room.
"How frightfully red her nose is become,"
observed Lady Tilney, soliloquizing, as she
looked at her own smooth cream-coloured skin
in the glass.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>



<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 2em;">CHARACTERISTICS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> Lady Tilney's character a hasty outline
has been attempted in the preceding chapter;
falling short, however, as it is confessed every
attempt must do, to delineate all its varied
features. Something, however, may have been
gathered, by viewing her in the midst of the
group assembled in her boudoir; and the portraiture
will be rendered still more distinct, as
the character of her associates are further developed.</p>

<p>Of Lady Tilney herself it may be said, that
that real or pretended contempt of rank which
she affected to entertain, arose from the circumstances
of her own parentage, which, on
her mother's side at least, was not noble; to
the same cause, also, may perhaps be attributed
her anxious irritability, ill concealed under a
forced gaiety, lest the respect and homage
which she considered to be her due, should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
be paid her. There was a restlessness in her
assumed tranquillity, wholly unlike the easy
natural languor of her friend Lady Ellersby,
to which she would gladly have attained, and
which it was always the object of her ambition
to imitate; but she never reached that perfectibility
of <i>insouciance</i>, which marks a superiority
of birth and station.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the part which she consequently
was obliged to play, there was still a
good deal of nature in her composition; much
more than in that of the person whose demeanour
she envied;&mdash;and had not her character
been influenced by a life of dissipation, she
seemed designed to have passed through existence
diffusing usefulness and cheerfulness
around her. Much might be said in extenuation
of Lady Tilney's faults and follies, courted and
caressed as she was; as indeed there is ever
much indulgence to be extended to all who, in
situations of power and of temptation (however
many their foibles) remain free from positive
vice. The voice of censure should be guarded
therefore in its condemnation; remembering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that the inability to do wrong, or the want of
allurement to yield to it, are often the sole
preservatives against similar errors.</p>

<p>In commenting upon such characters as
Lady Tilney's, it is not for the purpose therefore
of attaching blame to the defects of the
individual, so much as to point out the dangers
attendant on their peculiar stations, and to
shew how far even noble natures are liable to be
debased by constant exposure to a baneful influence.
Were not this the object of a writer,
idle and contemptible indeed would be the
pen, which could waste its powers in tracing
the vanities and follies of a race which always
has existed in some shape or other, and possibly
will always continue to do so.</p>

<p>There is an indulgence of spleen, a silly
gossiping espionage, which delights in prying
into the faults of others, without any motive
but that of the gratification of its own mean
nature&mdash;but there is an investigation into the
habits and manners of the actors in the scene
of fashionable folly, which, by dispelling the
illusion, may preserve others from being heedlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
drawn into the vortex of so dangerous
a career. A sermon would not, could not,
descend from its sacred dignity, to effect this&mdash;a
philosophical or moral discourse, would
have as little chance of working such an
end;&mdash;but a narrative of actual occurrences
may perhaps give warning of a peril, which
is the greater because it bears outwardly,
and on a cursory view, no appearance of
future evil; for to the young, and indeed
to all, there is a charm, and a very great
charm too, in being something superior, something
that others are not, or cannot be. No
one acquainted with human nature will ever
contradict this. The question of vital importance
to be asked is&mdash;In what ought this distinction
to consist? and what will really give
it? Certainly <i>not</i> a life of dissipation, in
which the affectation of new modes and manners
constitute the business of existence; certainly
<i>not</i> the sacrifice of moral and religious
duty, to a courting of frivolous homage and
the pursuit of an empty <i>éclat</i>.</p>

<p>These, however, it is to be feared, are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
generally the spurious objects of ambition with
persons in fashionable life, than the solid
advantages, and lasting fame, which their
situations afford them the means of securing.
And if it is thus with the world of fashion in
general, how much more was it the case in
the circle in which Lady Tilney reigned!
Herself and her friends had no thought that
tended to any specific moral purpose, in the
strict sense of the word. The duties that
were performed, were such only in a negative
sense; they went to church, they lived with
their husbands; some of them, but not all,
had escaped scandal; they were fond mothers,
at least in the eye of <i>their</i> world; they were
alive to their offsprings' interests, at least their
worldly interests; and beyond this, it is to be
feared, neither for them, or for themselves, did
their views extend.</p>

<p>Here may be closed the catalogue of their
moral possessions. Of their outward shew of
manner and courtesy, where so much in a <i>soi-disant</i>
empire of ton might be expected, perhaps,
there was still less to praise: a <i>brusquerie</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of address took place of polished breeding,
where intimacy permitted any address at all;
and where none was allowable, an insolent
carelessness marked the behaviour, instead of
that polite courtesy which is ever the distinguishing
mark of really good manners.</p>

<p>Lady Tilney, had she not stood on the
'vantage ground of <i>ton</i>, might have been
called vulgar: the loud and incessant talking,
the abrupt and supercilious glance and motion,
had it not been backed by title and an assumed
superiority, would have been designated by a
very different name from that under which her
manners passed current; and even as it was,
they sometimes received a reproof which, however
affectedly scorned, was deeply felt. An
instance of this occurred on the occasion of
her receiving the homage of a distinguished
foreigner; when, in the intoxication of the
moment's vanity, Lady Tilney forgot the
respect due to one of exalted station, rudely
turning her back, and brushing past him in the
dance, a disregard of etiquette which he
whose manners are all elegance and condescension,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
would never in his station have shewn
to the meanest of his subjects, and whose sense
of delicacy and propriety is so acute, that
wherever female manners are concerned, none
could better know how to condemn whatever
derogated in the slightest degree from them.</p>

<p>It was to the displeasure incurred by this
circumstance, and to the loss of favour which all
who have ever lived in its sunshine cannot fail
to lament when withdrawn, that allusion was
made, in speaking of Lady Tilney's contempt
of sovereigns and courts. Here was to be
found one bad effect of a system which, while
false in every sense, arrogated to itself perfection
in all.</p>

<p>There was no immorality to rebuke in this
instance of Lady Tilney's conduct; but it proceeded
from a source, which if not in her, in
others at least, might be productive of serious
consequences; namely, from a contempt of
established rules and received opinions; and if,
in the midst of this arrogance there was a redeeming
spirit of occasional kindness,&mdash;a smile
which took the heart captive for the moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and gave promise of better things,&mdash;it only
caused a regret that the good which was there
should be thus choaked by the noxious weeds
of vanity.</p>

<p>Some of Lady Tilney's companions in <i>ton</i>
had not, like her, escaped the breath of slander;
one or more were supposed to have listened,
at least, to that corruptive voice of gallantry,
which withers the bloom and freshness of a
married woman's reputation; whose error is
remembered long after its cause has passed
away&mdash;let it have been real or imaginary;&mdash;in
either case the effect on a woman's character is
the same. It is in vain that in a certain sphere
there exists a tacit agreement to pass by, and
gloss over such defamatory tales; the persons
coming under their degrading mark have a
seal set upon them, which, in spite of themselves,
and maugre the usage of <i>their</i> world,
is nevertheless destructive of peace; and it
requires little penetration to see beneath the
forced smiles which are put on with the adornments
of the toilette, the gnawing worm that
preys upon the heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The fatal effects of such errors attach only
to those guilty of them; the feeling inspired
for their situation would be one of pure commiseration;
but, alas! the influence of example
is contagious, and whatever is felt for the individual
who thus errs, the sentence of condemnation
must go forth against the crime. In
regard to the other members who formed Lady
Tilney's intimate circle, the Countess Tenderden,
Princesse de la Grange, Lady de Chere,
and Lady Boileau, for instance, there was equal
matter for remark, varying with the character
of each. The first of these, possessing nothing
decided in her composition, had been, from the
commencement, a follower in the track of
others, and it was owing to this laziness of disposition
that she became the ready and obedient
slave of fashionable command, as well as from
her early initiation into the secrets of <i>ton</i>,
rather than from any other cause, that she
held the place she did in Lady Tilney's estimation.</p>

<p>Lady Tenderden's unsatisfactory and frivolous
existence had thus been passed without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
any decided plan, except that of being generally
impertinent, and of courting personal admiration;
which, when it is paid to beauty
alone, ceases with the first cessation of youth:
the consciousness of which fact added no genuine
sweetness to the smile of Lady Tenderden;
but left her, although in the possession
of most of the outward circumstances
which could grace existence, with a fading person
and a dissatisfied mind.</p>

<p>Princesse de la Grange was a star in the
midst of this false galaxy of <i>ton</i>, in as much as
a strict regard to married duty, and a preservation
of moral and religious principle, gave to
her character a superior brightness; but whether
from the taint of the poisonous air she
breathed, or from a defect of strength of mind,
or from the situation she filled, or from all
these circumstances combined, the Princesse de
la Grange did not escape entirely the pollution
of folly, and she too delighted in the vanity of
being exclusive.</p>

<p>In the love of being distinguished above her
compeers, Lady de Chere, however, far excelled;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
attaining a perfection which her exceedingly
clever and powerful understanding,
together with the management of her conduct,
and an appearance of general decorum, enabled
her to preserve. Nor were her moral qualities
alone conducive to her success: she had besides
the advantage of being able to set her face like
a flint (which indeed it resembled physically),
and she deemed all emotion or all expression
of natural feeling (even that of bodily kind)
to be a weakness unworthy of a woman of
fashion. Lady de Chere was once known on
an occasion of personal suffering, when a few
tears actually escaped her, to have exclaimed
to her attendant: "You are the first person
in the world who have ever seen me guilty of
such weakness." Nay, she even carried this
perfection of induration so far, as to boast of
having cut her own mother.</p>

<p>In this last instance of the perfectibility
of <i>ton</i>, Lady Boileau yielded not the palm&mdash;she
had remained a good many more years
than she had bargained for, unmarried&mdash;she
had studied under a mother, whose lessons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
eventually were but too well rewarded in kind.
This mother, however, had loved <i>her</i>; and
with much and unremitting labour, had effected
for her an alliance of title&mdash;of wealth.
What more could either of them with their
views desire?</p>

<p>Lady Marchmont had established her daughter
greatly, and the daughter had accepted the
marriage upon certain calculations: such as
being her own mistress, independent of her
husband, or her mother; who knew too well
<i>de quel bois elle se chauffoit</i>, for Lady Boileau
to like her surveillance. Lady Boileau had
then made no scruple of swearing to love,
honour, and obey him whom she loved <i>not</i>,
held <i>cheap</i>, and determined to <i>resist</i>. But these
words, and too many more, bear a totally different
signification, it is well known, in the language
of <i>ton</i>, from what they do in their common
acceptation.</p>

<p>One of the first steps of Lady Boileau after
her marriage, was to gain admission into the
circle of Lady Tilney on a footing of intimacy;
for although she had been on visiting terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
with her, yet she was aware that the mere interchange
of cards did not constitute her the
friend or protégé of Lady Tilney, to which
distinction she aspired. There were one or
two circumstances, however, which rendered
the attainment of this object rather difficult.
In the first place, Lady Boileau had a mother
whom it would require more decided measures
to detach from her than, as it has been seen,
Lady Tilney chose to countenance. The general
tenour of her conduct, too, was a thing yet
unproved, and it was, therefore, still unascertained
how far she might be true to their <i>esprit
du corps</i>, and be worthy of admission into this
circle. Lady Boileau was considered, notwithstanding
these impediments, to be a person
of promise, and she was accordingly admitted,
with the tacit understanding, however, that she
was not to push Lady Marchmont indiscreetly
on the scene; where her wit and plain speaking
might break forth in corruscations too
potent for the <i>tendre demi-jour</i>, or rather darkness,
in which the proceedings of the <i>ton par
excellence</i> were invariably to be veiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>There was, however, one person whose name
has not yet figured in the catalogue, but whose
character of mixed good and evil, would require
a powerful pencil to delineate; for the
many amalgamating tints which united and
harmonised its opposing lights and shades were
any thing but an easy task to give&mdash;divested of
these, the portrait would become caricature.
How often does marriage, especially in early
life, give a colour to the future conduct of
women. Had Lady Hamlet Vernon married
differently, she was possessed of qualities which
would have rendered her estimable as well as
amiable; and was mistress of talents which, if
properly directed and matured, would have rendered
her a being distinguished above her sex.
But this was not so; she had married for situation,
and soon found the burthen she had imposed
upon herself far outweighed the advantages
she had contemplated in the step she had
taken. Unhappiness was the first natural result;
and in the absence of religious principle,
young, beauteous, and fascinating, she soon
found in the universal admiration paid her, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
delusive balm to alleviate the society of a husband
considerably older than herself, and who
had married her from the pride of calling a person
so admired his own. Under these circumstances,
Lady Hamlet Vernon could not remain
without the stigma of slander attaching to her.</p>

<p>The early demise, however, of Lord Hamlet
Vernon liberated her from the hazard of her
situation, and at five-and-twenty she found
herself again free. Titled, and with great
wealth at her command, she was too clever for
the empty votaries of folly, but too clever also
to be entirely set aside by them. She was, at
the same time, too much <i>sujetté à caution</i> to
be admitted on terms of unguarded intimacy
amongst those in her own sphere who were
observers of religious and moral conduct, and
who happily form the aggregate of distinguished
society in England. Left without choice, therefore,
as to who should be her associates, Lady
Hamlet Vernon was drawn into a society where
the errors of her early conduct were, by the
contagion of example, sure to be confirmed,
and the remainder of any good principles that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
she might have possessed, in danger of being
subverted; for it was not the least evil arising
out of the system of the society alluded to, that
the persons composing it were under a compact
of exclusion of all who differed from them
in habit and opinions; and, thus deprived of
the power of comparison, their own conduct
wanted that useful touchstone of its rectitude.</p>

<p>We are all alive to impressions daily
made upon us; and if a life of carelessness
and dissipation is not to be checked by an occasional
example of what is truly excellent
and worthy in character, the moral perception
between right and wrong of its mistaken votaries
will soon be blunted, till at last both their
ears and eyes are closed to all remonstrance.
The riper in years, therefore, were sure to have
their false estimate of life confirmed; <i>they</i>
could not return on their steps, even if they
wished it; while the young and the inconsiderate
were taught to believe, that those who had
so long followed in that destructive but glittering
career, were the only objects worthy of
imitation, and in their turn became hardened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
actors in the scene. Although the characters
hitherto produced as slaves to this system have
been of the weaker sex alone, still let it not be
imagined that they were its only victims, or
that they alone played their part in upholding
it.</p>

<p>If possible, the men of the society were many
of them as frivolous, and more vicious; and,
though here and there might be found a character
that, from family connection or ignorance
of the tendency of the society, mingled in its
contamination without infection, or making a
wreck of principle, yet, far from these solitary
instances detracting from the general truth of
what has been said, it will be found that such
persons, the moment they became aware of the
lurking evil, broke from it abruptly; though
perhaps, saving themselves with difficulty from
the entanglement.</p>

<p>In the members, however, which swelled the
list of the male part of this circle, few indeed
were there who ever made an effort to withdraw
from it. Vice and folly, in manners and
in dress&mdash;male coquetry&mdash;ineffable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
impertinence&mdash;ignorance&mdash;detraction of virtue which
might have resisted, or talents which eclipsed
them&mdash;insipidity in mind, and effeminacy in
person&mdash;devotion to luxury,&mdash;these, and more
than these, if such could be catalogued, of the
immoralities and follies of man, were all to be
found here, in degree and kind, revolving in
their different orbits&mdash;and fulfilling their allotted
parts in the system, till their existence
closed. What though wit might sometimes
play around their board, or the quick repartee
enliven the monotonous circle of the evening&mdash;what
though talent might be allowed, for a
brief season, to expatiate on higher topics,
and the deep discourse of great human learning
might be suffered to dwell at intervals on
subjects more intellectual&mdash;yet what profited
this to those who listened or to those who
spoke?&mdash;The moment's amusement, the indulgence
of mere curiosity, the establishing of
some political tenet or philosophical dogma,
were alone the objects looked to. Talents,
when found in this society, were in fact directed
to none but <i>worldly</i> views; and the feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
which should have guided their possessors to
acknowledge the bounty of the Author who
bestowed them, and a faithful employment of
his gifts, was not only wanting, but the sacred
religion of that very Author was too frequently
made an exercise for them&mdash;a subject
of their scorn or cavil.</p>

<p>Though untitled, yet of noble family, there
was one, who figured first as most licentious
and unprincipled among the devotees of <i>ton</i>.
He was handsome, winning, specious; but he
concealed under this attractive exterior a heart
of the blackest dye; no sense of right or wrong
checked its impulses. All to him was lawful
that was attainable. Pleasure was his object;
and he had sailed down the short voyage of his
life unchecked by any of those reverses, unscared
by any of those feelings of shame or
compunction, which would have operated on a
weaker mind; and if, for a moment, some
enormity of conduct made the more timid&mdash;they
could not be called the more virtuous&mdash;of
his associates recoil, the hardened face, the
laugh of carelessness, the ready excuse, soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
dissipated these transient feelings of shame;
and patronized, courted, upheld, in that true
<i>esprit de corps</i> which bound each member of
the society to protect the other, his youthful
career had been run from excess to excess.</p>

<p>Although a person whose weight and influence
in themselves were not great, yet he
formed from his habits and opinions, and the
talents which (though perverted) he really
possessed, one of those ties in a fabric, which
being multiplied, keep the whole body compact;
and, having once obtained a footing
in Lady Tilney's circle, it followed, as a
matter of course, that he should be employed
in that remodelling of her society, which it
has been seen Lady Tilney was so anxious to
effect, and his name therefore was not forgotten
in the list, concerning which she
intended to consult Prince Luttermanne.</p>

<p>It is well for human nature, that many
characters such as have been just described are
not often found; it certainly had no compeer
in the circle in which it moved. And though
the folly of dress&mdash;the waste of time&mdash;the uselessness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of life&mdash;indulgence in the excess of
luxury, are errors and faults that cannot be
too strongly held up to animadversion, yet
they are, by comparison, of a venial kind.
Their effects, however, ultimately do not prove
such; for degradation of intellect must follow a
course of indolence, and an obtuseness of conscience
must be the consequence of long-neglected
duties. Let it not be supposed, therefore,
that because Lord Boileau, Lord Baskerville,
Lord Marchmont, or Lord Tonnerre,
were younger and less matured in a vicious
course than another, that therefore their conduct
was less deserving of moral censure&mdash;the
seed that is sown in spring time will grow up
to the harvest, and it must be reaped accordingly.
The pursuits of a careless life of
pleasure, the gaming-table, the society of
opera dancers, the intrigues of <i>ton</i>, are not
preparations for the maintenance of family
consequence and wealth, still less for the fulfilment
of the duties of married life, the protection
of a wife's conduct, or the education of their
offspring. Yet these, it is to be feared, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the sole objects of Lord Boileau, of his companions,
and of many others.</p>

<p>Besides these, however, there were characters
intended to be included in Lady Tilney's arrangements
of a far different complexion, and
the very reverse of their inexistence&mdash;there
were noble politicians, whose lives were passed
in any thing but inactivity; there were titled
wits, whose places were any thing but sinecures;
poets, whose lays found frequent subjects in the
galaxy of beauty that surrounded them; and
painters, whose talents and winning flatteries
constituted their patent of nobility. The admission
of all the latter personages was a decided
evidence of Lady Tilney's supremacy; for,
with few exceptions, she alone considered that
to be surrounded by talents was essential to
high station, since with the generality of her
coterie, the idea of mingling intellect in their
pleasures, was rather to destroy than heighten
them.</p>

<p>Lady Tilney, however, in the end prevailed,
and no society of <i>ton</i> was in future considered
complete without those appendages. But even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Lady Tilney's command of the suffrage of
talents was not always absolute; and once, it
is said, a man of holy profession, whose celebrity
in his calling had led the London world in
crowds to be his auditors, though thrice bidden
to the shrine of fashion, declined, with steady
consistency, to form one of a circle whose conduct
in life it was his duty to reprove.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the list of cavaliers
is yet full with the names of the persons
just alluded to; there were many others too
insignificant to bear designation&mdash;and enough
of portraits. Catalogues of these can only be
interesting to a few curious collectors, and are
very unsatisfactory to the generality of persons.
It is living with the actors on the shifting scene,
which can alone, for any length of time, engage
the attention, or be productive of any just
understanding of the character. To note down
their actions as they occur, and to develope the
system by which their lives are regulated, will
be the easiest, as well as the most profitable
task; for although there may be something
which at first appears unnatural, and scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to be recognised as truth, in the idea that there
exists a regular and defined system in lives,
which at a hasty glance seem spent in the careless
manner of the persons represented, nevertheless
it is so&mdash;and there is a depth in their
folly, which requires to be sounded,&mdash;there is
a mischief in their apparent carelessness, which
it is wise to detect&mdash;there is a principle of
latent evil under this seeming incipiency of
conduct, which requires to be unfolded, and
shewn in its true colours.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 2em;">AN OLD-FASHIONED ASSEMBLY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the outlines of Lady Tilney's
project had been generally settled, yet some of
its details were still wanting; and in the interval,
she determined on one of those movements
in the game, which a crafty adversary sometimes
makes to cover an ultimate and deeper
end. The Marchioness of Feuillemerte held
one of her assemblies, and as it was admissible
to appear in such a circle once at least during
the season, <i>sans se compromettre</i>, Lady Tilney
devoted herself for that evening to the unpalatable
task, and engaged Lady Ellersby to
meet her.</p>

<p>After casting a glance of inquiry round the
room, "My dear," said she, "did you ever in
your life see such an heterogeneous multitude
(she loved long, hard words) as are assembled
here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, except here"&mdash;"Figures," continued
Lady Tilney, "<i>renouvellés des Grecs</i>&mdash;creatures
dug out of Herculaneum, only not so elegant;
all George the Third's court I believe;
and then such a tiresome eternity of
royalty, persons who never die, and whom
Lady Feuillemerte, and Lady Borrowdale
have preserved, together with themselves, in
spirits, I believe, to exhibit on their great
nights."</p>

<p>"Yes," rejoined Mr. Frank Ombre, who
had been permitted to overhear the whisper,
and smiling with one of those doubtful expressions
which might do for tragic or for
comic effect, "we do not want royalty now
to keep us in order,&mdash;that is quite an obsolete
idea. No, we have more enlarged views; we
like to turn every thing, <i>sans dessus dessous</i>&mdash;don't
we Lady Tilney? I am sure I had rather
bow to the sceptre of your beauty, than
to that of any prince or princess&mdash;and you
know I never flatter." At that moment a
royal personage entered the assembly, when
Lady Tilney, under pretence of going away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
hurried to the door, saying, "oh, do let me
avoid this <i>seccatura</i>."</p>

<p>"Do, Mr. Spencer Newcombe," addressing
this privileged friend of her own circle who
stood near her, "do call my carriage,"&mdash;in
the meanwhile placing herself in a situation
that made it impossible, without rudeness, for
the person whose approach she would have
appeared to shun, to pass her by unregarded;
a behaviour which, however consistent with
Lady Tilney's ill breeding, when she wished
to shew dislike, was never known to attach to
any of the family who were the objects of her
pretended contempt.</p>

<p>Lady Tilney did not, on the present occasion,
make her arrangements in vain, and was
not only spoken to, but held so long in conversation
by the royal person who entered,
that she had the satisfaction of hearing her
carriage repeatedly announced, till every
individual of the assembly must have been
aware of the cause of her delay. The dense
crowd, however, which now encircled the
prince, seemed to oppress Lady Tilney, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
affecting to be almost overcome by the pressure,&mdash;a
pressure which in fact she was herself
causing, by obstinately keeping her place, and
not allowing the conversation to drop&mdash;she
was at length gratified by an offer of the arm
of royalty to lead her to a seat, on which she
sank affectedly, while the prince took that
next to her. In one of the pauses of conversation
which ensued, Mr. Ombre chanced to
find himself exactly at the back of Lady
Tilney's chair, and she took an opportunity of
whispering to him, "how tiresome!" He
shrugged his shoulders, and replied in her ear,
"I pity you from the bottom of my heart,"
(adding aside to Spencer Newcombe), "As I
do every one who always succeeds in every
thing they wish."</p>

<p>Shortly after, the prince rose to depart to
speak to others, while Lady Tilney having
made good her right to royal attention, now
prepared to express her contumely of every
thing regal, and to resume the exercise of
her own right to absolute power in her own
person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do, Mr. Ombre, sit down and let me have
a <i>little</i> real conversation with you, for I am
sick of all the <i>fadaises</i> which have just passed."
"What a fortunate man," he rejoined, "shall
I be, if I have only a <i>little</i> conversation with
Lady Tilney!&mdash;you know I never flatter,&mdash;and
besides that distinction, a seat,"&mdash;dropping
carelessly into the one that was vacant.</p>

<p>But Lady Tilney did not read these words
otherwise than in the sense to which they were
agreeable to her, and immediately her hitherto
repressed eloquence broke forth.</p>

<p>"Have you read the Male Coquet? Do tell
me, is it not exquisite? Among all the trash
heaped upon people of fashion, this alone is
well done. It must be confessed that, in spite
of its severity, the whole is well drawn, and
though highly coloured, not a daub."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have read it, and I like it; but
the world don't."</p>

<p>"No! well I cannot conceive why&mdash;perhaps
you can tell me.&mdash;Not like it! indeed you surprise
me! Why, it has already gone through
three editions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, in the advertisements! but they say
the publisher is ruined, nevertheless."</p>

<p>"Well! that is quite extraordinary! I
thought all the world approved it."</p>

<p>"The world!&mdash;the world, my dear Lady
Tilney, is a very ill-natured world, though
you have never found it so; but you will some
day."</p>

<p>"Oh, do not imagine," cried Lady Tilney,
a little displeased at her supposed want of
discernment, "do not suppose that I am not
quite aware of the world's ill-nature&mdash;only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only you are bound, my dear friend, to
suppose it otherwise, since, in its opinion of
you, it does indeed make an exception."</p>

<p>"You know I hate flattery, Mr. Ombre."&mdash;"Well,
well, I have done; but in some cases,
what appears flattery, is truth. Besides, I
never <i>do flatter</i>."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Lady Tilney, "never
mind! let us return to the Male Coquet, I
have not half done talking about it. What
do you think of the character of Lord Algernon,
is it not delightful, is it not quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
perfect?&mdash;And for that very reason, quite
detestable."</p>

<p>"My dear lady, I never knew but one perfect
person in the world whom I could bear;
do you guess who I mean?"</p>

<p>"Dear me, are you still here?" said Lady
Ellersby, approaching at the moment.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you know when those royalties <i>will</i>
talk to one, it is impossible to get away."&mdash;"Ah,
true&mdash;and it is so fatiguing."&mdash;"Royalties&mdash;dose
royalties, and you mind <i>dem</i>?"
said the Comtesse Leinsengen, who had caught
Lady Tilney's words as she passed, leaning on
the arm of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>"My dear Lady Tilney, I wonder to see
<i>you</i> here&mdash;but you always do de reverse of
what you talk, you know&mdash;I tell your so."</p>

<p>Lady Tilney was embarrassed, and looked
around for an escape from the conversation.
She saw the half-formed sentence preparing
by Lord Rainham; which, however, she knew
must undergo the necessary process of
preorganization and arrangement before it was
addressed to her. Luckily the Comtesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Leinsengen pressed forward before this could take
place, and Lady Tilney, to avoid any more
sarcasm on her inconsistency, willingly allowed
for once the witty Lord to pass without a word.
Mr. Ombre, who was still by her side, and
had lost nothing of the scene, gave his word
of consolation to Lady Tilney, as he remarked:</p>

<p>"How appropriate to the situation which
he fills;&mdash;the ready orator, the decided projector
of measures and expedients,&mdash;how truly
great a minister! You know, Lady Tilney, I
never flatter. I really think so." Lady Tilney
had no wish to continue the subject, and turning
to Lady Ellersby, remarked,</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such jewels as the
Duchess of Hermanton's? How vulgar to wear
them in such quantities; she is like a walking
chandelier. But, look, there is Lord Arlingford;
he is coming this way&mdash;I want to speak
to him, and if you move a step or two forward,
I shall be able to do so." Lord Arlingford
was accordingly arrested on his passage,
for he had not intended to converse with Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Tilney, but was looking on towards a group of
persons, in the midst of whom stood the
Duchess of Hermanton. "Well, Lord Arlingford,
how surprised I am to see <i>you</i> here;
are you not bored to death?"</p>

<p>"Why, Lady Tilney," he asked, in return,
"should you be surprised to see me in an assembly
to which half London is invited?"</p>

<p>"That is precisely the reason," she replied,
"I should have thought you never went to
these sort of things; they are very tiresome,
and I am sure you must be dreadfully annoyed."</p>

<p>Lord Arlingford was not an apt <i>élève</i> of
Lady Tilney's, although his high rank and
connexions had made her sedulously endeavour
to direct his education in the world of
<i>ton</i> from his very first <i>début</i>.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, not in the least <i>ennuyé</i>. I
do not come often enough, or remain long
enough in these places, to be sickened by the
shew&mdash;and <i>as</i> a shew, it is a very splendid one,
and I like to see so much beauty as is here to-night
gather together."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fewer at a time," said Lady Tilney,
"would be more agreeable, I should think."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, for habitual private society;
but then that is quite another affair: all things
are good in their way, and in their proper
season and measure." Lady Tilney was mortified
at this very rational distinction of the
indocile Lord, but went on to say, "At least
you will allow that a circle more <i>choisie</i> is
preferable&mdash;and one comes to this sort of mob
only as a kind of disagreeable duty."&mdash;"Duty!
that is quite a new idea of duty to
me&mdash;but I am happy to be taught by so fair
an instructress." As he spoke, Lord Arlingford's
grave countenance (for it was a countenance
of gravity for so young a man) relaxed
into something like vivacity; and Lady Tilney,
profiting by the momentary gleam of expression,
requested him to assist her through
the crowd, in order that she might speak to
the Duchess of Hermanton.</p>

<p>"You will come, will you not, Lady Ellersby?"
turning her head over her shoulder as
she spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"No (for at this moment the Duke of
Mercington was coming towards her), I have
already seen the Duchess." Lady Tilney
would then have lingered, glad to have exchanged
the arm on which she leant for that of
the man of still higher rank; but the Duke only
making her the acknowledgment of a familiar
nod, offered his arm to Lady Ellersby, and as
her friend walked away in a contrary direction,
Lady Tilney, mortified, bit her lip, and was
obliged to proceed.</p>

<p>The crowd in the door-way soon stopped
her progress, and turning to her companion,
she observed,</p>

<p>"I wonder how many private couriers Lady
Borrowdale keeps in pay, to bring over the
newest fashions from Paris. Have you seen
her to-night? did you ever behold any thing
like the magnificence of her gown?"&mdash;"I
think," replied Lord Arlingford, "that she is
a very fine-looking person, and in her youth
must have been perfectly beautiful; but I did
not observe her gown." The subject seemed
to inspire Lord Arlingford, who broke through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the usual briefness of his sentences as he continued,
"And her manner, I think, is excellent;
there is so much dignity in it, united with
so much courtesy; and she is never, I am told,
capricious, or forgetful of good-breeding."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear Lord Arlingford, this is
an oration&mdash;you are quite eloquent! But you
cannot really like that old-fashioned <i>manière</i>
of curtseying."</p>

<p>"Indeed I am serious; I like it very much:
and if I were to point out the person whose
manners I should like to see any one I loved
adopt, in public at least&mdash;for I have not the
honour of her intimate acquaintance&mdash;it would
be Lady Borrowdale's."</p>

<p>"How singular you are! Really, if you
entertain such opinions as these, we must
expel you from our circle. But if you are
determined to be extraordinary, I suppose
you will tell me that you cannot bear any
thing that is younger or more modern."</p>

<p>"Pardon me; there is Lady Georgina Melcombe,
and the Ladies Fitzmaurice, and their
cousins, the Ladies Partington, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
others, who look as if they were every thing
which the young and lovely ought to be,&mdash;unaffected,
cheerful, and courteous."</p>

<p>"Oh, this is worse and worse; you are becoming
quite insufferable. But do tell me
who is that person there, whose appearance is
so particular, and who has so extraordinary an
air&mdash;is he a foreigner?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that is Lord Albert D'Esterre. Are
you not acquainted with him? He is a very
charming person,&mdash;full of talent, and very
handsome, as you see. But I forget&mdash;you
cannot well recollect him, for he went to the
Continent as a boy, and is only lately returned."</p>

<p>"True; I remember&mdash;I hear he is likely
to distinguish himself&mdash;pray present him to
me."</p>

<p>The presentation took place; and, after a
few words, including an invitation to Lord
Albert to her <i>soirées</i>, Lady Tilney passed on
with Lord Arlingford to where the Duchess of
Hermanton was standing.</p>

<p>To have taken pains thus to seek one whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
she affected to despise, whose manners and right
to fashion she was perpetually calling in question,
might argue great inconsistency; but in
this instance Lady Tilney's wishes to be well
with the Duchess of Hermanton, far from
being the result of any thing like the contradiction
of a settled principle, were the absolute
fruits of it, and were influenced by a feeling of
fear&mdash;if she would have confessed it&mdash;by an
apprehension that that really amiable person,
possessing the envied superiority of united
rank and birth and talent, should assume her
proper place in society, and overthrow the
false rule to which Lady Tilney herself laid
claim. It was therefore conciliation rather;
and, as she addressed the Duchess, she put on
her sweetest smiles, and laid aside those indescribable
airs which were displayed when she
intended to scorn or crush; and, while uttering
those nothings which form the sum and
substance of what is said on such occasions,
her manners were almost servile. The simplicity
of unquestioned superiority is one of its
most sure characteristics; and the Duchess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Hermanton's mode of receiving this homage
was unaffected and courteous. But as the two
persons had little similarity in their natures,
the conference lasted only sufficiently long for
Lady Tilney to preserve that degree of familiarity
in acquaintance, which she determined
should prevent her being a stranger to one too
independent and distinguished to be altogether
passed over.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lord Arlingford having profited
by the opportunity to quit Lady Tilney, now
joined Lady Georgina Melcombe and some of
the persons standing together in another part
of the room; and Lady Tilney, thus left alone,
had, for a few moments, leisure to behold the
splendour of the apartments and of the persons
met in them. In her heart she could not but
acknowledge that whatever London could boast
as being most distinguished was present, and
that the good and great predominated; but it
was <i>not exclusive</i>&mdash;that is, it was an assembly
constituted of almost all those whose rank entitled
them to be on the list of Lady Feuillemerte's
visitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>It was numerous, therefore, which is the very
essence of an assembly; for what is so insipid as
public receptions where the members are few,
the rooms half filled, and the scene unenlivened
by those circumstances which a diversity of
ages, characters, and dresses cast around?</p>

<p>Here all met the society which best accorded
with their tastes. The politician, the courtier,
the man of fashion, found here their associates
and their amusement, each in their different
sphere, as they retired from the rest to discuss
some present topic of public interest, or glided
through the throng with that easy politeness
which breathed of the atmosphere they inhaled
in the presence of their Sovereign, paying the
well-timed compliment as they passed, or displaying
the refinement of wit and repartee in
their short and animated conversations.</p>

<p>Here, too, amidst the younger and fresher
forms, beauties of former days still shone in
the dignity of their manners, and of that air
and carriage which the fashion of their time
had rendered a portion of themselves; which
lent a grace to their every movement, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
might well have afforded a school of manners
and propriety of outward bearing for the young
who mingled with them&mdash;in counteraction of
the oblivion and extermination of all manners,
which the prevailing system of the <i>soi-disant</i>
members of <i>ton</i> would have enforced.</p>

<p>Such, at least, were the external features of
an old-fashioned assembly&mdash;in its moral character
the advantages were no less. Its honest
and avowed purpose was the interchange of
those courtesies which render life agreeable,
and the preservation of those general guards
in society which, as checks to profligacy, are
more useful than abstract theories of ethics, or
codes of moral laws. People, unless lost, sin
not so blindly in mixed communities&mdash;one individual
forms a restraint on the others&mdash;children
stand in awe of parents, and these, in their
turn, acknowledge a wholesome control in the
presence of their offspring&mdash;the good are a
terror to the evil (for an alloy will ever exist);
while the one and the other mutually afford
examples of imitation, or beacons of danger to
be avoided, which every individual may, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
there be the will, turn to profit, in the correction
of some temper, the curbing of some
excess, the chastening of some wish, or the
abandonment of some folly.</p>

<p>The more intimate associations in life are
not here spoken of; but these in characters of
the same description as Lady Feuillemerte's,
would doubtless be founded on the same basis,
and have the same objects in view; for whether
in the cherishing of natural affections, the formation
of those friendships which spring up
in the domestic circle, the cultivation and exercise
of talents which give a charm to existence,
or the acquirement of more important
attainments, the system which holds out examples,
and affords restraint, will ever be
best.</p>

<p>The "<i>société choisie</i>," however, which Lady
Tilney desired to form, was, in its nature, the
very reverse of what has been described. Its
exclusive character was to consist, not in the
selection of what was amiable in nobility, or virtuous
in talent; it was not to be the circle
drawn within a narrower circumference, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
more perfect enjoyment of private friendship,
or the cultivation of more intellectual pursuits
than the wide range of fashionable life could
afford; it was not to be retirement from the
busier throng, for the purposes of a more
rational and purer existence; but it was to
consist of those whose follies in the pursuit of
pleasure, and whose weakness in the indulgence
of all the empty toys of life, had given
them a distinction above their fellows; of those
who judged immorality, when burnished by
the tinsel of superficial acquirements, as venial
error;&mdash;of those, in short, who were either
senseless or wicked enough to consider life but
a bubble, to be blown down the current,
according to the dictates of the will, and whose
daily existence testified, that they were alike
without a thought or a fear for the morrow's
eternity. Such were to be its members, and
its seclusion from the general eye of the
world, its secession from all others but&mdash;; its
rigid law, that unmarried women were not
eligible to its chosen meetings&mdash;for what purpose,
and to what end were these? If for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
vanity of distinction, merely, it was weak; if
for the purpose of indulging in pursuits and
conversation, which would receive a check in
a society less selected for the object&mdash;it was
wicked. In whichever point of view, a society
so constituted must be demoralizing, for
assuredly it would have the character of being,
if it even were not, really vicious&mdash;and its
example would have a contaminating effect in
the corruption of morals, and the overthrow
of the barriers of domestic peace.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that these were the reflections
of Lady Tilney, as she stood for the few
moments alone in the crowd at Lady Feuillemerte's.
It would be injustice to her to suppose
that they were, or that she contemplated
in the formation of a coterie, according to her
own peculiar prejudices, any of the evils with
which the system was sure to be pregnant. It
is thus, however, with all reforms, entered
upon for private ends; the individual sees but
the accomplishment of his own and his immediate
associates' views, in what is to be overturned;
and the fatal result accruing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
community, even if clearly distinguished, are
at the moment but as dust in the balance of
self.</p>

<p>It is more probable that, as Lady Tilney
gazed on the mingled group around her, blind
to the demerits of her projected revolution of
society, and proud of influence, which over a
certain portion of the London world she had
succeeded in establishing, she became firmer
in her purpose; and as her eye fell on one
individual after another, whose manners, mode
of life, dress, or very name were disagreeable
to her, or proved them wanting in the stamp
of ideal fashion, the necessity of the measure
she contemplated she conceived became more
and more imperative. Whatever might have
been Lady Tilney's reflections, she was not
long suffered to indulge them. In the tide
which passed before her appeared Lord Rainham,
unattended however, as previously, by the
Comtesse Leinsengen: Lady Tilney therefore
awaited his address, without any appearance of
recurrence to her professed distaste for royalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"A marvel, I declare!" were the opening
words of a speech already polished, <i>usque ad
unguam</i>, before Lord Rainham ventured to
give it utterance.&mdash;"Behold Lady Tilney
without a crowd of worshippers at her feet!&mdash;Explain
me this phenomenon, and say, have
you been cruel to your slaves, and are they
gone themselves, or have they forgotten their
allegiance? Such things have been, though
they ought not to be&mdash;and yet methinks you
would find it sufficiently dull, if all things
were as they ought to be, would you not?
tell me the truth, and give me your confidence;
I have long wished to have the confidence of a
handsome woman, and I promise you <i>indulgentia
plenaria</i>."</p>

<p>"No, not for the world!&mdash;I hold it to be
quite a false maxim to have any confidants:
besides I have nothing to confide."</p>

<p>"You are too wise to be so handsome,"
said Lord Rainham abruptly, "and so
good night; for since you will not parley
with me, 'tis in vain I linger;" and as he
turned away, words of fresh <i>impromptu</i> on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
some other subject began audibly to escape
his lips.</p>

<p>"In your orisons be all my sins remembered,"
whispered Mr. Ombre as he passed,
and again found himself at Lady Tilney's side.
"It is high time such bookworms as I should
retire into our cells; so, lady sweet, good
night.&mdash;You know it is not I who speak,
but he, who would have been blest, could he
have poured all his sweetest lays into that
gentle ear." Lady Tilney considered the
homage of talent as peculiarly her own, and
would gladly have retained the speaker; but
gliding with the gentle undulation of some
shadowy form towards the door, he escaped
the infliction of a penalty, which even the
syren smiles which were his reward could
hardly at times repay.</p>

<p>It was now growing late&mdash;the assembly was
breaking up, and Lady Tilney looked anxiously
for some <i>cavalier</i> to attend her to her
carriage: but this was not a point of easy settlement.
In degree he must be either of rank,
or a dependent&mdash;one who was her equal, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
one on whom she might confer distinction by
her choice of his services. Neither such requisites,
however, were to be found in the
group around, and Lady Tilney, whilst feeling
yet more and more the necessity of an exclusive
circle, where such predicaments would be
avoided, was doomed still further mortification
in the approach of Colonel Temple, a person
whom she hardly ever considered recognizable,
and whose offer of assistance, made evidently
with sarcastic reference to her being alone,
came in a shape particularly offensive to her.</p>

<p>"Will you allow me to have the honour of
calling your carriage," he said, addressing her
with easy familiarity; "or if you are going to
walk through the rooms, allow me to escort
you?" (offering his arm).</p>

<p>"No," said Lady Tilney, in a manner that
might have awed any one else; "I am going
away immediately."</p>

<p>"Well, then, let me call your carriage," he
replied, with a tenacity that nothing could
evade&mdash;whilst Lady Tilney continued to move
on, terrified lest she should be seen <i>so</i> attended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>This apparent anxiety to avoid him, was,
however, with Colonel Temple, the surest incitement
to a continuance of his proffered attentions.
It might not have been exactly consistent
with the general, high breeding and
politeness which distinguished Lady Feuillemerte's
assemblies, for any one to have acted
under this influence perhaps; but Col. Temple
was a character known to all the world as such,
and privileged to do things which no one else
did. He was a man, too, of family, and felt
his situation in society, in the midst of all his
eccentricities. His want of refinement had its
compensation in an honesty of disposition quite
at variance with the measured forms of fashionable
exclusiveness, but which made him generally
beloved; while his shrewd sense, mixed
with a certain vein of sarcastic humour, always
penetrated the littleness of vanity, and
often inflicted on it its severest wounds.</p>

<p>Lady Tilney, from repeated slights, was a
darling object of his attacks, and could she
without compromise have purchased immunity
from their never-failing and successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
arrogance, by an honourable truce, she
would gladly have done so. But Col. Temple
was <i>too</i> arrogant, <i>too</i> presumptuous, to be
checked by any defiance of ultra fashion&mdash;too
independent, too high-spirited, to suffer a cold
and haughty recognition, in place of the politeness
and courtesy due to him as a gentleman,
and thus this warfare had become interminable.</p>

<p>Enjoying his triumphs in the way in question,
he followed Lady Tilney from room to
room&mdash;even to the steps of her carriage, assuring
her as they proceeded, that her apprehensions
of being detected in his society were
compliments to him beyond price; he was
aware that, to be of importance, the next thing
to being liked, was being feared&mdash;and bidding
her be sure to send him a card for her next
choice <i>soirée</i>, he handed his victim into her
carriage, under a thousand half-pronounced
inuendos upon his insufferable vulgarity, and
the awful anathema of future exclusion.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 2em;">A MODERN COTERIE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">If</span> any circumstance had been wanting to
give strength to Lady Tilney's resolves on the
momentous question of social reform, the occurrences
at Lady Feuillemerte's were in themselves
sufficient&mdash;at least, they formed an addition
to that kind of plausible excuse, sought
for on all occasions where the will is previously
set on a particular line of conduct, but which,
without a pretext, it would hardly be safe for
the individual to adopt.</p>

<p>The motley and unkindred assemblage of
the previous evening, with its royal restraints,
its want of organization in its inferior members,
and the consequent offences experienced
by those of higher order&mdash;for Lady Tilney, although
she did not divulge the stain inflicted by
Colonel Temple's assiduities, yet felt it
deeply,&mdash;were points she dwelt upon to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
colleagues in the following morning with that
extreme pathos and eloquence which the sufferings
of self never fail to produce, and
which could not but enforce on her auditors
conviction of the necessity of the measures
she proposed.</p>

<p>Closeted, therefore, with the leading characters
in her own peculiar circle, the final
arrangements for that <i>société choisie</i> which was
to eclipse courts and banish sovereigns, to
school rank, and bring to maturity all the yet
unripened follies of a <i>soi-disant ton</i>, were at
length concluded. The lists were full&mdash;the
doors were closed to all but the secret representatives
of the system, and the anathema
went forth. Strange that St. James's did not
shake from its foundation, England's sovereign
resign his sceptre, and her lengthened line of
nobility crouch in the dust, under the awful
denunciation of such an ascendancy. But
though this were not so&mdash;yet must the loyalty
of many a high-born subject, and the purity
of many a noble and virtuous mind, have been
outraged, when the results of a system at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
so contemptuous and immoral began to be developed.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Lady Tilney
had already fixed on the evening of Lady
Borrowdale's assembly as a fitting occasion
for the display of her own undivided rule in
the empire of fashion. Her cards had been
issued for that purpose, and these were now
followed by injunctions through various channels,
requiring an early attendance&mdash;since the
two syrens of the day, Pasta and Sontag, it
was whispered, were engaged to give additional
effect to the opening charms of exclusiveness,
and render the blow struck at the existing
state of society at once decisive.</p>

<p>Lady Borrowdale's apartments, it was decreed,
should possess only the <i>canaille</i> of the
fashionable world, and royalty be doomed to
oblivion there, in the surpassing lustre which
Lady Tilney's circle would display. To the
authority that called for this ready obedience,
none of the satellites of Lady Tilney's court
were ever known to offer resistance;&mdash;and
though the chiefs of her party alone knew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
real object of the summons, yet the uninitiated
hastened to obey it with the same alacrity as
their superiors, satisfied that in so doing they
were best consulting their views of advancement
to the distinction courted by them, as
well as securing a greater license in the indulgence
of those follies and errors which made
the sum of their daily occupation.</p>

<p>To tell of the decoration of the apartments,
of the splendour and luxury which reigned
around the mansion of Lady Tilney, to dwell
on externals, would be to repeat descriptions
a thousand times given, and tend to no
developement of import. A plant, under the
fairest guise of colour or of form, sometimes
contains within its fibres the deadliest poison;
and in the scorching plains of the East, the
upas-tree extends an alluring shade over the
exhausted and unconscious traveller, who is
soon to sink beneath its deadly atmosphere.
But what would it profit were the naturalist
to dwell only on the pencilling and texture of
the one, or the traveller describe vaguely the
outspreading branches and inviting coolness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the other, and yet neglect to record the noxious
qualities and inherent dangers of each.
The plant and its virtues, not the scene in
which it is to be found, must first be recognised
and known, if escape from its contagion
be intended;&mdash;and it is to the habits
and system of a people, not to the country
they inhabit, that we must look, rightly to
understand the manner in which their lives
are passed.</p>

<p>To a casual observer, Lady Tilney's assembly
presented no distinguishing external marks
at variance with received habits or customs.
The rooms were not darkened, the servants
passed through the apartments at intervals in
the performance of their respective duties
without constraint: the company, however, was
less numerous, and more scattered and divided
into detached parties. The conversation, with
the exception of Lady Tilney herself, was
carried on in a low tone, scarcely audible but
to the individual addressed; the different
members of the coterie, when they moved about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
seemed to do so under certain measured and
stated paces.</p>

<p>It was not, however, the step and air of real
dignity of fashion, but rather the mincing
<i>minauderie</i> of <i>des petites maîtresses</i>. Whatever
was done or spoken (when for a moment some
general observation was hazarded), appeared as
if performed by rule, and under apprehension
of drawing down ridicule, which at once went
to destroy all natural grace of speech or demeanour.
This sentiment attached more particularly
to the younger and newer noviciates,
who felt that an unguarded expression, or a
movement at variance with the prescribed forms
of the circle, would render them the objects of
the malicious remarks and sneers of the more
experienced&mdash;an uneasy restraint, therefore,
was often the consequence; and had it not
been, that to form part of so chosen a society,
and under Lady Tilney's roof, was in itself an
indescribable satisfaction&mdash;some who were there
might have been suspected of suffering considerable
<i>ennui</i>, and of being ready to admit,
by the suppressed and ill-concealed yawn, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
although the honour of exclusiveness was great,
the pleasure was certainly small.</p>

<p>Not so, however, with the more initiated&mdash;these
appeared by habit to take the part at
once most to their tastes; to select the
companion most agreeable to them; to remain
under the eye of observation, or retire from it,
as they chose, with indifference;&mdash;for it was not
only in <i>what</i> was done or said, but in the
<i>manner</i>, also, that the distinguishing
characteristics of this coterie were to be detected.
All things were lawful&mdash;but then under outward
forms (not however of propriety always, or of
morality), but of convention; and whoever
attained fulfilment of these, had the privilege,
the <i>indulgentia plenaria</i>, as proposed by Lord
Rainham, to sin with impunity.</p>

<p>When it was said, therefore, that an assembly
composed as the present differed not in its
appearance from others passing under the
same generic name, it was premised to be only
under the impression of a first view;&mdash;a more
intimate acquaintance with many of its laws
and practices, so opposed to received customs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in the world, could not in the end fail to
astonish! And first the observer (the moral
observer is meant) would have been struck by
the discovery, that the young and beautiful in
this magic circle were all married women, and
that the person who individually (for the
number was rarely more than singular) paid
his assiduous court, leant over the chair, and
whispered into the ear of the fair whom he
selected or was selected by, was no aspirant to
her hand in marriage, no relative&mdash;neither was
he her husband&mdash;but a member of the privileged
society, which was alone sufficient.</p>

<p>His astonishment would have been yet
stronger on discovering that for a season, till
mutual convenience, or disagreement dissolved
their familiar acquaintance, each party, similarly
paired, invariably met, conversed, and retired
at the same time, when the circle broke up,
or when they quitted it, apparently on the
same footing of intimacy which the most holy
ties could have sanctioned; while those whom
such a tie actually bound to them were themselves
pursuing a similar career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Had the conversation which for the most
part occupied this portion of the <i>société
choisie</i> been reported, or reached the ear, it
is possible a considerate mind might have thought,
notwithstanding the singularity of a system which
excluded the unmarried from scenes of amusement,
that it was well they formed no portion
of it; but still, in an escape from its early
influence, enjoyed the opportunity of attaining
to a degree of moral principle, and feminine
decorum, which must otherwise have been
swept away in the general license.</p>

<p>This, however, can unfortunately be said
only of the one sex&mdash;the unmarried in the
other, provided their attainments were of the
kind to authorize admission, were not on the
excluded list; and the young, well-principled,
and ingenuous perhaps at their outset, might,
in the examples constantly before them, have
found incentive to conduct, which at a future
day they would discover to have been the
great bane and poison of their existence.&mdash;Of
these the person who entered Lady Tilney's
apartments when the coterie had nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
assembled, and who was new to most of them,
offered an instance, for whom the liveliest fears
with justice might have been entertained.</p>

<p>Young, strikingly handsome, talented, of
high rank, of widely extended interest, and
possessing all the means of gratifying every
wish, to what dangers was not Lord Albert
D'Esterre exposed, in such a scene as has been
described, and on which he was from that
evening to play a part! He seemed, with the
impulse of natural politeness, to look around
for Lady Tilney, as he entered, as if he would
pay his first homage to her, whose self and not
her house he visited; in a manner directly the
reverse of that false refinement of modern <i>ton</i>,
which seeks a display of its <i>savoir vivre</i>, in a
pointed indifference to all the received forms
of society.</p>

<p>Before he had reached the second room he
was met by Lady Tilney, with a greater
degree of courtesy and <i>empressement</i> than was
usual in her receptions; and his address
was listened to with more complacency and
patience than generally marked her manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
towards any one.&mdash;"Who is he?" passed in
whispers round the circle amongst those to
whom he was unknown.&mdash;"Did you hear his
name announced?"&mdash;"No! I have seen him
somewhere before, I think&mdash;is it not Lord
Albert D'Esterre, Lord &mdash;&mdash;'s son?"</p>

<p>"Ah true, it is! but what an extraordinary
lengthy speech he is making&mdash;surely Lady
Tilney must be ready to expire under its
duration."&mdash;"Not under its dulness, I am certain,"
said Lord Glenmore, as he caught Lady
Baskerville's remark to Lord Rainham, "for,
D'Esterre is too clever ever to say a dull thing."
"Or ever do a wise one, perhaps," added Lord
Rainham in his most caustic manner.</p>

<p>"Did you hear Rainham?" whispered
Spencer Newcombe to Ombre; "there was
no time for gestation there&mdash;it was really
well said."&mdash;"Then, if so," replied his neighbour,
"we may 'for once a miracle accept instead
of wit.'"</p>

<p>"No; I do not allow of miracles now a
days," said Lord Rainham, turning sharply
round, having overheard the remark applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to him: "I do not believe in miracles&mdash;not
even in the resurrection of the Glacier man&mdash;do
you, Ombre?" The laugh was with the
latter speaker; but Mr. Ombre thought that,
in fact, miracles had not ceased when Lord
Rainham could thus improvise two good
things without incubation; and so he whispered
into the ear of his friend Spencer Newcombe,
as Lord Rainham moved away.</p>

<p>While Lord Albert D'Esterre was thus affording
subject of remark to the coterie, and their
observations in turn made matter of ill-natured
review among themselves, he was addressing his
courteous excuse to Lady Tilney for having
disobeyed her commands, in arriving so late.
Lady Baskerville was probably right in her
conjecture, that Lady Tilney felt considerably
bored by his doing so, and making reference
to injunctions which she had forgotten the
moment they were given, because certain they
would be generally obeyed, and Lady Borrowdale's
assembly be left untenanted by all
her early visitors.</p>

<p>She heard him, however, with smiles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
outward complaisance; for Lord Albert was
of consequence enough in a political way, at
least, for Lady Tilney to court; and as she assured
him that he was still in good time, and
that the Sontag had not yet sung, presented
him to several persons, whom, she remarked,
would be almost strangers to him after so long
an absence from England.</p>

<p>In all, however, that Lord Albert had said,
he had been sincere; and in his manner towards
the different persons he was made known
to, there was a genuine distinguished air of
high breeding and politeness, as much at variance
with the manners, as his ingenuousness
was with the minds and dispositions of those
who figured in the moral masquerade before
him. Although fresh in this scene, and therefore
without contamination, he was powerful,
and, therefore, worth appropriation; and what
was considered <i>outré</i> and too <i>manière</i> in his
address, was partially overlooked at the moment,
as certain to give way under the powerful
influence of better examples.</p>

<p>The Sontag now came forward and poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
her liquid notes mellifluous through the assembly.
Every body was in raptures&mdash;indiscriminate
raptures;&mdash;for though raptures were
generally obsolete, there were a few short
seasons for a few new things in which it was
permitted to be rapturous; but woe to the unhappy
individual who, ignorant of the mark,
gave way to these ebullitions at unallowed
times, or beyond the peculiar limits prescribed
by <i>ton</i>.</p>

<p>When the <i>aria</i> was concluded, however,
the remarks among the younger votaries of
fashion were principally directed to the figure
and appearance of the singer, rather than to
her performance. Leslie Winyard admired her
foot; Lady Boileau her eyes; Lord Gascoyne
saw indescribable beauty in the delicacy of her
waist; and Lord Tonnerre declared her neck to
be as fine drawn and as perfect as that of a
race-horse&mdash;a simile which was perhaps the
only figure of speech the latter lord could
have hazarded, consistently with his knowledge
of any subject. These by turns approached the
singer, and as they addressed her with an air of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
familiar condescension, seemed in their ungentle
gaze to seek an opportunity of confirming
their previous judgments; which, according
to the result, were signified in the presence
of the persons by a look, or a whisper, to one
another.</p>

<p>If a few ventured an observation on what
they had been listening to, it was in a tone
either of indiscriminate praise, founded on
some one's opinion in their own circle from
whose decree there was no appeal; or else,
measuring things in themselves admitting not
of parallel, by one another, they drew an unfair
comparison between the powers of Sontag
and of Pasta; just in the same way as a pseudo
connoisseur would measure the merits of Paul
Veronese or Tintoretto by those of Raphael.</p>

<p>"I am surprised you waste so much time in
this discussion," said Mr. Ombre, who was
standing near the parties debating on the latter
point; "there can be no question as to the
merits of the case&mdash;Sontag is new."</p>

<p>"Is she not enchanting?" asked Lady Tilney,
addressing Lord Albert D'Esterre, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
had been listening with the utmost attention&mdash;"quite
perfection!" He smiled; "I do not
know that I ever heard or saw any thing <i>quite
perfect</i>; at all events, I prefer Pasta."</p>

<p>"Well, you surprise me!" replied Lady
Baskerville; "there is such brilliancy&mdash;such
lightness, such fluency in the Sontag."</p>

<p>"But there is more depth, more pathos, more
poetry in Pasta. Nevertheless I admire
Mademoiselle Sontag; and because I prefer one,
I am not deaf to the powers of another singer&mdash;a
feeling of the sublime does not exclude the
lesser sense of the beautiful."&mdash;"What a prosing,
sententious popinjay; ay!" whispered
Lord Baskerville to Lady Ellersby.</p>

<p>"But he is very handsome," she answered.</p>

<p>"I know not what you ladies may esteem
handsome" (and here Lord Baskerville put
himself in his best possible form, and bent his
cane against the ground); "but I can see nothing
in that stiff conceited face and figure to
call handsome; and I would not be doomed to
listen to his affected pretensions for half an
hour together on any condition whatever&mdash;no,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
not to hear Sontag sing three songs consecutively&mdash;beautiful,
charming, dear as she is!"</p>

<p>"Does beauty enter in at the ears?" asked
Spencer Newcombe.</p>

<p>"Not exactly; but it goes a great way
towards making what does enter there agreeable,"
replied Lord Baskerville.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Sir Henry D'Aubigne,"
addressing that celebrated artist: "is not the
Sontag exceedingly lovely?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I have not yet had an opportunity
of judging," was Sir Henry's discreet reply;
for he gave offence to none. "There is considerable
grace and play of countenance certainly;
a fine-cut eye; and on the whole I
should say she was a very pretty creature. But
really, in this land of beauty, (looking round
him as he spoke), one may be allowed to be
difficult, and where there is so much to dazzle,
confess oneself unable to decide."</p>

<p>"Sir Henry is almost as graceful in his
speech as in his portraits; I wish I were such a
poet!" sighed Mr. Ombre, "and then I might
hope to turn all the ladies' hearts, for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
accept your homage, but will not mine, although
I never flatter."</p>

<p>Thus did the poet and the painter mutually
pay their allotted fealties to the sovereigns of
<i>ton</i>, when the whisper ran round the room that
the Sontag was again about to sing.</p>

<p>During the performance, Lord Albert
D'Esterre was standing at the back of Lady
Hamlet Vernon's chair, addressing to her, at
intervals, his conversation on the merits of the
singer.</p>

<p>"I am told," said Lady Hamlet Vernon,
when the music ceased, "that the Sontag is
very like Lady Adeline Seymour. You will
know, Lord Albert D'Esterre?" Lord Albert
coloured.</p>

<p>"I do not see the least resemblance to my
cousin;" and then he added: "I was not
aware that Lady Adeline had the advantage of
your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"I have not the pleasure of her's neither&mdash;I
hear she is a most delightful person!" Lord
Albert again coloured, and felt his heart beat
quicker at the mention of a name so dear to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is Lady Dunmelraise expected in town
this year?" continued Lady Hamlet Vernon;
"I understand she has very bad health. A
very intimate friend of mine, from whom I
sometimes receive a letter, Mr. George Foley&mdash;you
may perhaps know him&mdash;and who is at
present staying at Dunmelraise, informs me
that she is far from well."</p>

<p>Lord Albert D'Esterre found himself irresistibly
drawn towards Lady Hamlet Vernon,
by the circumstance of her knowledge of Lady
Adeline Seymour, and they continued for a
long while in conversation&mdash;till interrupted by
Lord Rainham, who, quitting the circle of the
political characters of the day, with whom he
had been in apparently close discussion, addressed
Lady Hamlet Vernon on some other
topic, and Lord Albert turned aside.</p>

<p>"Tell me what is your real opinion of the
person you have been conversing with?" said
Lord Rainham, in a low voice, while his small
quick eye followed Lord Albert; "is he clever?
has he talent&mdash;tact, or any other serviceable
quality?"&mdash;"I hardly know how to answer inquiries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of such depth," answered Lady Hamlet
Vernon, smiling; "had you asked me if he
were agreeable, I could have answered yes.
But to what do your questions tend&mdash;are they
general or particular; or are they political, or
what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I mean, is he like other people, like
other young men&mdash;empty&mdash;and conceited?&mdash;or
has he wherewithal to make his conversation
endurable&mdash;worth listening to&mdash;point&mdash;repartee&mdash;subject&mdash;does
he talk of people or of things?"</p>

<p>"Of both. But shall I add another to your
list of inquiries&mdash;To what side of the question
does he lean? Does not this sum up all you
would know from me? And what if I should
tell you&mdash;I know nothing about the matter?"</p>

<p>"Psha! well: that may be too&mdash;what <i>do</i>
you think&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Why I think him very handsome."</p>

<p>"Aye, may be so; I dare say he is&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But has he avowed his political creed?
will he support your favourite measures, or
oppose them? I know that is all you wish me
to say," replied Lady Hamlet Vernon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, to be sure, one judges in these days
of a man's sense a little by his politics&mdash;one
learns whether he thinks at all, or follows his
interests."</p>

<p>"Oh, you all do that, my dear lord. But
come; I will tell you what I think of Lord
Albert D'Esterre: I think he is worth winning&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will try," said Lord Rainham.</p>

<p>"Fi donc!&mdash;now I will tell you no more."
And Lady Hamlet Vernon left the foiled diplomatist
to lament the failure of his mission, and
learn to play his part better for the future.</p>

<p>The evening, or rather the night, was wearing
fast away; the Sontag had sung three
times, and those who had formed part of Lady
Tilney's first <i>soirée choisie</i> were soon to be left
in possession only of the recollections&mdash;no&mdash;not
the recollections&mdash;the life of the aggregate
assembled there would banish such an exercise
of mental powers&mdash;but in possession of the fact,
that they had been of the chosen number; that
they <i>had</i> heard the favourite of the hour, <i>not</i>
in the too-frequented Opera, but in the privacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of the drawing-room; and that they alone could
justly, therefore, weigh her merits, and determine
her defects.</p>

<p>In follies such as these a large portion of Lady
Tilney's associates were sure to find gratification
on the morrow. And it might have been
well had all contented themselves with these, so
comparatively harmless, although such worthless,
fruits of <i>exclusive ton</i>; but it may be feared
that, with some, the result of that evening,
and the prospect of others to succeed it of the
same kind, held out objects of a far different
complexion, which a sure immunity from censure,
and a complete freedom from obnoxious
comparisons, successfully tended to promote.</p>

<p>Lord Albert D'Esterre had turned away
from a group of young men with whom he had
been conversing, and whose discourse, assuming
a tone and character equally indelicate and
revolting to his feelings, he thus endeavoured
to avoid, when he found himself near Lady
Boileau.</p>

<p>"Lord Albert D'Esterre," she said, addressing
him, "if you will excuse an invitation so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
destitute of form, will you do Lord Boileau
and myself the pleasure of dining with us on
Saturday&mdash;I will send you a card." Lord
Albert bowed with courtesy, and expressed
himself sorry that he was already engaged,
and, after some conversation of little interest,
as Lady Boileau's carriage was announced,
she left the room. Leslie Winyard, with the
familiarity of one well acquainted, whispered
in Lord Albert's ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have <i>échappéd belle</i> from that."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>"Why, I mean that you have escaped a most
uncomfortable concern by just refusing the
invitation to the Boileaus."</p>

<p>"I thought I heard you say to Lady
Boileau but now that you would be delighted
to wait upon her."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, certainly, one <i>says</i> those sort of
things; and if nothing better occurs, one <i>does</i>
them;&mdash;but it does not always follow: for
instance, if any one were to ask me whom I
liked better, or if you, or some equally pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
person, were to propose our dining together at
Crockford's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not a member of Crockford's," said
Lord Albert D'Esterre, gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh! but your name is down, and <i>you</i> are
certain of being admitted on the next ballot,
and&mdash;" Lord Albert attempted to reply, but
Leslie Winyard continued, "and, as I was
telling you, if a pleasant dinner was prepared
at Crockey's, I should, of course, not starve
myself at the Boileaus."</p>

<p>"I confess myself at a loss to comprehend
what you mean."</p>

<p>"Well then, some day go and try; find
yourself frozen in rooms where the fire is lit
only five minutes before the hour of your
expected arrival&mdash;starve at the hands of the
very worst cook in England,&mdash;and then, when
you hear that my Lady spends twelve guineas
on a new bonnet, squanders thousands on her
journies to Paris, and ruins Boileau in articles
for her toilette, <i>marvel</i>&mdash;but the thing is so."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" Lord Albert continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
saying to himself; as the person who had been
talking to him turned away, half in derision of
his unsophisticated expressions and manner of
receiving what he said,&mdash;"is it possible that so
much refinement of duplicity can exist, for an
end so trivial&mdash;where the gratification of the
spirit of falsehood, or the indulgence of an
ill-bred impertinence, is the only object?"</p>

<p>Whilst thus musing, and preparing to leave
a scene which, as he became more acquainted
with the actors, appeared little suited to his
tastes or modes of thinking, he saw Lady
Hamlet Vernon approach the door unattended.
A recollection that she alone, in the manner
she spoke of Lady Adeline Seymour, had
seemed to have any sentiment in common with
himself, made him move towards her, and
inquire if he could be of any service in seeing
her to her carriage.</p>

<p>"I do not know if it is up," was her reply,
"but perhaps you will have the goodness to
ask." He did so, and in the interval, before it
was announced, they continued conversing.
"<i>Je vous félicite</i>," said Lord Rainham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
addressing Lady Hamlet Vernon in a low tone
as he passed, and looking significantly at the
same time at Lord Albert D'Esterre.</p>

<p>"There is no cause," she replied, "I am
waiting for my carriage, and I think it will never
come."</p>

<p>"<i>Discrète</i>," answered Lord Rainham, as
he moved towards the door, and signalled what
he had observed to Leslie Winyard, whose
answering nod expressed concurrence in his
suspicions.</p>

<p>It was long before Lady Hamlet Vernon's
carriage arrived, and she continued talking
with Lord Albert on various topics; the
societies of Paris and Vienna, compared with
that of London; the state of the Opera, and
the prevalent bad taste of music on the Continent.
She inquired for many who in their
exile in this country had been known to her,
and with whom, in the splendour of restored
rank and fortunes, she found Lord Albert
had lived on terms of close intimacy. In
speaking of them he seemed to dwell with
pleasure on their recollection of the services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
rendered them in England, as a bright trait in
the human character, which betokened feelings
that it was plain to see were in accordance
with his own generous and noble nature&mdash;and
which had formed the basis of that familiar
intercourse in which he had lived with them.
Although the reverse of this picture has been
ascribed to too many foreigners, who have
with justice been accused of ingratitude, it
ought not therefore to be recorded that all
were subject to such condemnation. Lord
Albert knew otherwise.</p>

<p>As he extolled their characters and perfections,
and spoke of the charms which their
society had always possessed for him, Lady
Hamlet Vernon listened with increased attention,
as if she would have gathered from his
discourse the individual sources of that satisfaction,
which he professed in so lively a manner
to have found. "You are warm and enthusiastic
in your eulogiums," she said: "I hope
that in England, also, you may find those
whom, with the same reasons, and an equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
ardour of attachment, you will be disposed to
admit to your friendship."</p>

<p>There was something in the tone in which
these words were addressed to him, that made
Lord Albert D'Esterre for a moment fix his
eyes on the speaker; but they were as quickly
withdrawn, when he saw Lady Hamlet Vernon
blush, apparently confused, and then pluck a
flower from a vase near her, while she endeavoured
to hide her face by inhaling the perfume.
There was an awkwardness in the
pause which ensued, which neither seemed at
the moment able to surmount; when fortunately
Lady Hamlet Vernon's carriage was
called, and as Lord Albert handed her to it,
he received an invitation to her house in the
evening, when Lady Tilney's <i>coterie</i> were to
assemble there.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 2em;">"NEWSPAPERS"&mdash;"THE PARK."</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> newspapers of the following morning
had devoted columns to the description of
Lady Borrowdale's entertainment, and the
numbering of the distinguished persons assembled
there; the dresses, the apartments, the
decorations, the viands, and every minute
arrangement, were all detailed with an accuracy
which an eye-witness of the scene would
readily have acknowledged, and which none
but an eye-witness could possibly have succeeded
in giving.</p>

<p>In a far less conspicuous and pretending manner,
did the announcement figure in the same
paper, that "Lady Tilney yesterday evening
received a select circle of her friends at her house
in &mdash;&mdash; Street, where the Sontag gave several
specimens of her unrivalled talents." An uninstructed
reader would have been misled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
these harbingers of public events; and from
the tone of the respective <i>affichés</i> feel justified
in the conclusion, that the one must have been
the production of Lady Borrowdale's own
pen, or at least from her dictation, while the
other appeared naturally as the result of that
publicity, to which the actions of the great
are always subjected. But this would have
been far from the fact, or rather the very
opposite to it; it was to the milliners, the confectioners,
the musicians, the <i>maître d'hotel</i>, and
the other individuals interested in affording
publicity to the dresses and entertainments of
their employers, that the long and circumstantial
details of Lady Borrowdale's, or any other
great assembly, are to be attributed; free from
any petty interference, or the gratification of a
silly vanity on the part of the principals themselves.</p>

<p>That this was the fact, was a circumstance
which could not escape Lady Tilney; and
aware that such evidence, if it reached the
public eye, would destroy at once all the
sacredness of her select <i>coteries</i>, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
charms of the <i>société choisie</i> which she was
labouring to form, she determined on suppressing
it, and issued orders, not to be disobeyed
with impunity, for the effectual prevention of
any announcement of whom the circle consisted
of on the evening in question, and of its
proceedings, with the exception that it excelled
all other of the same date, by the possession
of Sontag's inimitable powers. A mystery,
which suited well with the ideas of Lady
Tilney and of her friends on the subject of
exclusive <i>ton</i>, would thus, she conceived, be
thrown over their actions, and the rites of the
supreme deity of fashion impenetrably veiled
from the prying, inquisitive eye, and vulgar
imitation of its pretending votaries.</p>

<p>Humility is a duty of as especial injunction
in the sacred volume, as its opposite is of strict
prohibition; and let it not surprise, therefore,
that Lord Albert D'Esterre, young in the
world's masquerade, and imbued with feelings,
which if not religiously grounded, were at least,
from their purity, analogous to the moral doctrine
which religion teaches, should be struck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
as he perused the two paragraphs, by the apparent
vanity of the one compared with the
unostentatious wording of the other, and drew
his inferences accordingly.</p>

<p>"What silly pomp in Lady Borrowdale;
how unworthy her rank&mdash;how positively little,
thus to set forth the splendour of her entertainment,
which is worth nothing when it loses
the character of being a natural consequence
of her station in society. What could be more
brilliant than Lady Tilney's assembly; and yet
there is no parade&mdash;no <i>catalogue raisonnée</i> of
all that was seen, done, or said in her drawing-rooms&mdash;how
much more like a woman of real
fashion."</p>

<p>Had Lord Albert D'Esterre been acquainted
with the actual truth, in all probability the
opinion which he passed on this trivial circumstance,
as he took his breakfast, would have
been the very reverse of what it was; and,
however he might hold cheap any silly ostentatious
display of wealth or rank, he would
certainly have been more ready to overlook
Lady Borrowdale's carelessness whether her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
assembly was reported accurately, or not at all,
than he would have been to forgive Lady
Tilney's over-anxiety and ultra, <i>ton</i>ism (if
such a word may be coined), to screen the
names and numbers of her guests, and give
celebrity to the coterie by making it a matter
of secrecy and of injunction to her domestics.</p>

<p>The mornings of Lord Albert, however,
were generally passed in reflections of much
more use and importance than such as newspaper
subjects could furnish. During the
whole of his residence abroad, his time had
been employed in acquirements of a solid kind.
He had studied men and things&mdash;had made
himself acquainted with the constitutions, governments,
resources, and political importance
of all the great European states; had lived
amongst their inhabitants for the purpose of
acquiring that accurate knowledge of their
habits and dispositions, which tends so much
to a just appreciation of the line of policy to
be observed towards them, and which must
ever be influenced by an acquaintance with
national character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>While receiving their instructions he had
formed friendships with some of their most distinguished
literati in all the different branches
of knowledge, and had returned to England
fully prepared for the commencement of that
public career to which his inclination led him;
and in which, amongst those who knew him
intimately, and could appreciate his abilities,
he was justly expected to shine.</p>

<p>The habit of occupation which he had formed
whilst thus pursuing his studies on the Continent,
did not desert Lord Albert D'Esterre,
even in the noise and bustle of London society,
in the midst of which he now found himself;
but in the mass of business which now fell
upon him in consequence of his taking possession
of his large estates, in the conferences of
lawyers and agents, in the answering of letters
on these matters of varied interest which now
occupied him, and in the attentions to those
minor cases of life, the etiquettes and forms of
the world, he still found leisure for serious and
studious application; nor indulged in the idleness
of fashion till the duties of the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
had been performed, when alone he availed
himself of them, for the purpose of relaxation
and the unbending of his mind.</p>

<p>It was the morning after Lady Tilney's
soirée, and when he had gone through his
usual course of occupations, that Lord Albert
recollected, with what would be called old-fashioned
politeness, "the propriety of leaving
his cards with the persons to whom he had been
presented the preceding evening, and more
particularly with Lady Tilney herself; and he
determined to do so on his way to the Park.
On arriving at Lady Tilney's door he was informed
that she was at home (for his name
was already on the list of those who had the
entrée), and he was preparing to dismount
when he saw the carriage of the Countess Leinsengen
drive up. She bowed to him, and he
was presently at the <i>portière</i> to hand her out;
and offering her his arm, conducted her to
Lady Tilney's boudoir. "Comment ça va-t-il
chère Comtesse," said the former addressing
her; "I congratulate you on possessing de
acquaintance of de only polite Englishman I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
have ever known&mdash;Dare is milor Albert D'Esterre
had vraiement de galanterie to get off
his horse and conduct me from my carriage.
N'est-ce pas merveilleux in dis country!"</p>

<p>Lord Albert bowed to the compliment; but
added: "I am sure Lady Tilney will not allow
such a cruel sentence on our nation to pass
even your lips, Comtesse; and will agree with
me, that though a few may have taken up a
false system, and assumed an air of disregard
to the courtesies of life, yet it is only such as
seek for distinction by false means, and by
doing the reverse of what others do: we cannot,
therefore, allow the censure to be general
on us all; indeed, I do my sex but justice I
hope, when I say, that they are in this country
invariably the friends and supporters of women,
and&mdash;" "Oh yes; perhaps if one tumble
down, or break one's leg, or meet vid any
personal danger or affront, dis may be so; but
dese affairs do not arise every day: and for de
little cares of de men, <i>les petits soins</i>, I never
knew one of your country men who knew vat
dey meant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Albert smiled at the manner in which
the argument in favour of his politeness was
maintained; but perceiving Lady Tilney little
inclined to keep up a conversation on the
subject of national manners, he refrained from
drawing the comparison, which would have
been just, between a natural politeness, arising
as much from feeling and imbued delicacy of
sentiment, as from habit, and the mere outward
forms of courtesy and etiquette, which in
those most profuse of them have seldom any
thing of sincerity.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose ve must go to dat tiresome
Almack dis evening. You go?" said the
Comtesse Leinsengen, addressing Lady Tilney;
"for my part I tink I shall viddraw my
name."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly I shall go," replied the
latter, "for it is absolutely necessary you
know, my dear Comtesse, that some of us
should be there; and besides I am of opinion
that as people must have something to keep
them quiet, and which <i>they think recherché</i>,
Almack's is as good as any thing else, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
therefore I shall support it&mdash;In regard to <i>us</i>,
I agree perfectly with you, it is <i>passée</i>, and
no longer what was intended." The Comtesse
shrugged her shoulders: "You will be
at Almack's to-night," said Lady Tilney,
turning to Lord Albert D'Esterre, "although
we are giving it such a bad name, will you not?"</p>

<p>"Your hours of admission are limited you
know, and I scarcely think I can get away
in time from &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no debate of consequence, is
there?" rejoined Lady Tilney with earnestness&mdash;"I
may forget, but should there be, of
course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did not mean from the house," continued
Lord Albert, "but I am going to dine where
I shall meet Baron H.; I have known him on
the continent, and his conversation is so very
interesting."&mdash;"And so very long," added the
Comtesse Leinsengen, interrupting him, and
with a look which was intended to repay many
discussions she had been constrained to endure
at Lady Tilney's hands; "I wonder he ever
finds people to listen to him."&mdash;"But where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
do you dine," said Lady Tilney, seeming to
disregard the opinion just uttered. "I know
Barnette, and he is very agreeable, very
clever, but I wonder he allows himself to be
so <i>fétéd</i> by people so little known in the world.
I shall be happy, I am sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am to meet him at the Miss D.'s," replied
Lord Albert, interrupting her, and who
felt that <i>this</i> was the point he was called upon
to answer, and not that of who were or who
were not known in Lady Tilney's estimation.</p>

<p>"And do you really visit them?" said the
latter with great surprise, "are you not
<i>ennuyé</i> to death at their parties?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ennuyé!</i> no&mdash;but then I must premise that
I never am so under any circumstances."</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>bon!</i> do tell me how that is, Milor,"
said the Comtesse Leinsengen, "precisely, do
tell me how you avoid infection from dat prevalent
disease of your island, dat <i>bore</i> you call it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I always do what I like," replied
Lord Albert with a smile.</p>

<p>"Cela ne fait rien à l'affaire, one do not
always know vat von like."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have nothing to reply to that; but for
myself, if I do not find exactly what I like
I always endeavour to extract entertainment
from the persons or place, where, or with
whom I may chance to be."</p>

<p>"Par exemple, at the Miss D.'s, what can
you find at their horrible conversaziones to
keep you awake," asked Lady Tilney, "c'est
un ennui à périr, it makes me yawn to think
of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, he goes to do penance for his sins,
and purchase indulgence for dose to come,
n'est ce pas, Milor?"</p>

<p>"Neither, I assure you; I was really more
entertained during a <i>soirée</i> there last week than
I have been since my return to England."</p>

<p>"Ah, le beau compliment! de grâce do not
avow it," said the Comtesse.</p>

<p>Lady Tilney looked amazed at these opinions,
like one in doubt if she had not with
too much precipitation admitted an enemy
within the camp, in the person of Lord Albert;
and whilst canvassing the necessity of retrieving
her error, by his future exclusion, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the same time the policy of retaining one
of his interest and promise in her circle, with
a view to his reform, she directed her enquiries
to him in a tone almost dictatorial, as to the
ground of his faith in the merits of the society
he had been extolling. "Will you tell
me, Lord Albert, of whom are these parties
generally composed? I have yet to learn that
there are distinguished individuals capable of
creating such great interest apart from what is
generally termed the society of London; or,
I must conclude&mdash;but I will not do that
hastily&mdash;that you yourself have imbibed ideas
quite foreign to propriety, and have given way
to associations quite unfitting your situation in
the world."</p>

<p>Lord Albert in his turn seemed astonished
at these categories, but answered with perfect
ease: "I have found at the Miss D.'s many
whom I meet elsewhere and, every where; but
my chief attraction is the number of talented
persons who are often assembled in the circle,
and whose conversation affords me the greatest
interest, and much instruction."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"One do not go into society to be instructed,"
said the Comtesse Leinsengen with
a sneer.</p>

<p>"Surely not," added Lady Tilney, "clever
people are well in their way,&mdash;I mean your
really learned persons&mdash;men who have read,
travelled, written all their lives, but then it is
in one's own apartment in the morning that
they are sufferable. I know but very few indeed,
who are presentable, or who have the
true talent of turning their powers to account,
without torturing one to death with their
learning; and then without great circumspection
they become familiar, and one is obliged
to take so much trouble, and be so much on
one's guard, to keep them in their place. Be
assured, Lord Albert, you will find this to be
the case," continued Lady Tilney, "if you
give unlimited encouragement to <i>gens de ce
grade</i>&mdash;There is but one subject on which you
may listen to them, I mean politics; but how
few there are of the class who are enlightened
enough to speak on that subject. We have, it
is true, D&mdash; and B&mdash; C&mdash;, and the Count K&mdash;,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
sometimes with us; and among our own countrymen,
we have M&mdash; and a few others, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Countess Leinsengen's impatience was
here manifested by the usual shrug of her
shoulders, and as she perceived Lady Tilney
embarking on the interminable ocean of politics,
turning quickly to Lord Albert she
enquired,</p>

<p>"But who may be de very clever persons,
Milor, who give you so much amusement in
dis very charming society?"</p>

<p>"Where there are so many to name, it is
hard to select," replied Lord Albert; "but
there was the great traveller, who has been
further into the interior of Africa than any
one has yet penetrated. His descriptions of
deserts, and skies, and camels, conveyed me
beside him in his pilgrimage; the trackless
sands in which no insect can find subsistence;
the well by which the caravan halted, the
only visible friend of the traveller throughout
the vast desert; the wide canopy of starry
heavens, spread out above; those heavens and
those stars, of whose clear brightness we in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
these cloudy regions have but a faint idea;
the varied and picturesque garb of guides and
guards; the meekness of the patient camel;
the silence of the march, unless some alarm
from the fierce and wandering tribes of the
country disturbed its tranquillity; and then
the noise, and gesticulation, and activity, which
accompanied the pitching of the tents for the
night's or noon's repose, were circumstances
all described and dwelt upon by the traveller,
with a nervous strength and accuracy of delineation
which nothing but original description
can give, and which came to me with so much
force and truth, and such beauty of imagery,
that I thought, as he spoke, travelling was the
only delightful way of passing one's life."</p>

<p>Lady Tilney and the Comtesse Leinsengen
exchanged looks, while Lord Albert was thus
giving way to the natural feelings of a mind
yet untinctured with the follies of fashion, and
which saw no degradation to his rank in seeking
and finding amusement in the society of
enlightened persons.</p>

<p>"Tell me," at length asked Lady Tilney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
with an expression something like contempt,
"had you no <i>changement de décoration</i>; was all
your talk about camels, and deserts, and wells,
and stars?"&mdash;"Ah," cried the Comtesse Leinsengen,
"<i>avouez moi, Milor, que la nouvelle
du jour vaut been mieux</i>." Lord Albert smiled,
and allowed that this was amusing too in its
way; but he added,</p>

<p>"We had a change of divertissement I assure
you, after dinner; <i>Il cantar che nel' anima si
sente</i> took the place of conversation for a time,
and Mr. M&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh he is well enough," said Lady Tilney,
"in his place, and sings charmingly;" (for the
person in question was the Anacreon of her
party, and sometimes tuned his lays to subjects
on which party feeling and political animosity
loved to cast derision)&mdash;"he is well
enough."&mdash;"And sings, do you not think,"
rejoined Lord Albert, "divinely? I have
heard others sing finely&mdash;sweetly&mdash;scientifically&mdash;even
feelingly; but such lightness, such
magic bursts of imagery, such painting of
sounds, I never heard but in his song."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you have heard de Sontag: you
heard her dis last evening?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, often; I heard her at Vienna before
she came to England."</p>

<p>"Well, and you prefer dis little gentleman&mdash;<i>tout
les gens sont respectables</i>;" and she
sneered, as if in contradiction to the words.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the parties will not bear a comparison,"
added Lady Tilney, jealous of one
whom she patronized, and whose merits she
had in a measure acknowledged; and then,
turning to Lord Albert, she continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must not mistake me, my dear lord; I
have no objection to the <i>sort of thing</i> you have
been describing. I honour talent, and delight
in conversation; but then it must be on a proper
footing; in circles where those persons
who talk, and talk very well I dare say, should
be under restraint; where they would feel themselves
debarred entirely from <i>undue</i> license, and
a consideration that they formed part of the
society, and where they would appear in their
true characters&mdash;to direct and amuse others
when called upon; just as actors and singers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
come upon the stage to play their parts, and
then retire. Now in the circle you allude to
all this necessary distinction is overthrown at
once&mdash;every one there, from the nature of
things, considers himself <i>pair et compagnon</i> of
the company, and behaves accordingly. In
small rooms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>On meurt de chaud au de froid, par parenthèse</i>,"
interrupted the Comtesse, who dreaded
one of Lady Tilney's long discussions; "for
dere is one moment a thorough air, and de
next all is shut up, and one fries vid de fire;
but dat is always de case where dere is no <i>poêle</i>
stove&mdash;However, adieu ma belle; I must go
and leave you and Milor dere to settle all de
points about dat société which he likes so
much&mdash;adieu&mdash;<i>au revoir, Milor, je vous salue</i>."</p>

<p>Lord Albert would have followed his natural
impulse of politeness, and handed the Comtesse
Leinsengen to her carriage; disposed,
perhaps, also to escape further conversation
with Lady Tilney on topics where they seemed
to hold no ideas in common. This, however,
he was not permitted to do, the Comtesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
declining his offered arm, saying she should never
be forgiven if Lady Tilney were deprived of
the triumph of converting him from his errors;&mdash;and
closing the door, as she insisted on his
remaining, Lord Albert was left tête-à-tête
with Lady Tilney.</p>

<p>"Do you not think she is terribly gone off
this year?" said the latter.</p>

<p>"I do not know if I understand you. If it
be that her beauty is gone off, I should say
yes&mdash;but I never heard she <i>was</i> handsome."</p>

<p>"No?" asked Lady Tilney, with an expression
of satisfaction; "but she is surely very
<i>distingué</i> looking."&mdash;"She has the advantage
of that species of polish which the world gives,"
was Lord Albert's reply; "but this often covers
an unpolished mind&mdash;and I am not sure it is
the first thing I should look for."</p>

<p>"I like nature as much as you can do, my
dear lord; I ever stood up for that liberty and
freedom attendant on persons not quite <i>fait au
feu</i>; but I must confess that I like to have
them a little dressed, <i>not perfectly raw</i>."</p>

<p>How far Lord Albert might have found it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
possible to agree with Lady Tilney in this new
question, so suddenly started, it was not left
him to discover; for at that moment fresh
visitors were announced&mdash;and, as they entered,
Lord Albert prepared to depart. Not, however,
till Lady Tilney&mdash;who, spite of what she
called his false theories, saw he was a person by
no means to be hastily rejected&mdash;had bidden
him to her box at the Opera on Saturday evening.
"I am determined to be at the rising of
the curtain," she said, "to hear the Sontag&mdash;only
it is so difficult to be in time. Were you
ever in time in your life?"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," answered Lord Albert,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Then be at the very <i>premier congé d'arche</i>
on Saturday," added Lady Tilney, as he bowed
to her and left the apartment; glad to have
gotten over a visit of ceremony, where, from
the tone of conversation which had passed, he
augured that little in future would be found
consonant to his ideas or his tastes.</p>

<p>As he rode from the door, Lord Albert
turned his horse towards the Park. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
one of the first Spring days that had shone in
the early year, and all the gayest of London
seemed hastening to enjoy its genial influence.&mdash;Yes,
even the weary and the <i>blazé</i> in life's
crooked paths appeared for a moment to acknowledge
the charm which the brilliancy of
the scene and the brightness of the atmosphere
combined to form. Smiles were in every face
and cheerfulness in every movement.</p>

<p>Than the throng of Hyde Park there is perhaps
no promenade in Europe more dazzling;
none where more magnificence of equipage, or
more beauty of human form is displayed; and
it is difficult for the young, and the handsome
more particularly, not to feel intoxicated as
they enter on a stage where the whole appearance
is so fair, and where a consciousness of
personal charms assures them they must themselves
shine.&mdash;It is not probable that Lord
Albert D'Esterre, philosophical as he has just
appeared while discoursing with Lady Tilney,
was altogether free from feelings so natural to
his years, or from that species of vanity which
seeks a display of personal beauty, or whatever
other quality may best glitter in such a scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>He was young, strikingly handsome, possessing
a form of perfect symmetry, and moreover
one of the finest horsemen of his time.
What wonder then if, as he sought the crowded
road of the Park, something like self-love had
a share in the direction which he took, and the
choice made of the spot where he might breathe
the balmy air of such a day. As he joined some
of his acquaintances in the Ride, and stopped
to speak to others, passing from right to left
and from north to south in the gay and splendid
crowd, his recollections were naturally
turned to similar parades in other countries,
and he felt pride as an Englishman in considering
how far our national display of beauty
and of wealth outshone that of other capitals.</p>

<p>"Neither Vienna, nor Paris, nor St. Petersburgh,
can rival this, Glenmore," he said, in
the buoyancy of his gratification at the scene&mdash;"nothing
that we ever beheld there is comparable
with this&mdash;now is it?"</p>

<p>"You have chosen your day well," replied
the latter, "because, if it had been one of
those three hundred and sixty-five days of mist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
which we generally enjoy in this metropolis, I
should be disposed to dispute the point with
you, and set the sunshine of a Parisian Spring
against the brilliancy of our ladies' eyes and
the splendour of their retinues. And would
you not agree with me?"</p>

<p>"Why, as a mere animal, I might, perhaps&mdash;climate
does affect our <i>physique</i>, I will
allow; but the national pride&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, bah! my dear D'Esterre your national
pride in this instance has nothing to do with
the matter;&mdash;and if the belles of Paris, or
Vienna, or the Calmuck beauties of St. Petersburgh,
could rival ours, their horses and coach-makers
surpass what you see before you, and
their summers be eternal, your <i>amour de la
patrie</i>, I fear, would not long continue <i>to bias</i>
your judgment. No, no, D'Esterre, that feeling
does not live on food like this; but we have
other and better sources for it, as you well
know and feel."</p>

<p>Lord Albert's face shewed, in the generous
glow which suffused it, a sense of his friend's
appreciation of his sounder judgment; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
added, with a smile, "if you will not allow my
present admiration to proceed from such a
noble spring, at least do not accuse me of a
reverse of sentiment, if I draw a comparison,
in another respect, not at all favourable to my
countrymen. Do you observe that line of men
drawn up in battle array, and with impertinent
nonchalance passing judgment on the women
who drive before them? It must, or ought to
be, at least, offensive to the pride and delicacy
of the former; it would shock any European,
and is a custom more suited to eastern despotism,
and to the rules of an Asiatic slave mart,
than to a civilized nation."</p>

<p>"But do you conclude, therefore, that the
men are alone to blame in this?" asked Lord
Glenmore; "and is it to be presumed that
they would have forgotten the courtesies and
respect due from them, if women in general
had been more true to the delicacies and
decencies of their own sex. Do justice to the
men while you blame the practice of the day,
and acknowledge, that if the nod, or motion of
the hand, or impertinent glance of recognition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
now takes place of the bow and respectful salutation
of other times, yet that there must have been
a sufferance of the change, if not an encouragement
of it, and an equal alteration of manners on
the other hand, or it would never have been."</p>

<p>"I dare say you are right, Glenmore; and
if so the more the pity. But although custom
sanctions all change in reciprocal demeanour
between men and women, yet because the stiff
and <i>manière</i> address of the last century was
laid aside with the silk coat, and bag-wig, and
sword, I do not see why courtly manners should
have been exiled at the same time. So long as
society is to exist on a proper footing, there
must be an outward shew of proper feelings;
and when all deference in minor points ceases,
it is quite certain that all consideration of
respect in more serious matters will cease too."&mdash;"What
is that I hear?" cried Leslie Winyard,
riding up to Lord Glenmore's side, and
nodding familiarly to his companion;&mdash;"what
is that I hear about proper feelings, and all
consideration of respect? You are not moralizing
in Hyde Park I hope."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"D'Esterre says that you men do very wrong
to sit on your horses, rank and file, and let the
ladies parade before you; and I think what he
says is true."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" replied Mr. Leslie Winyard, and
looking round in Lord Albert D'Esterre's face
with a sneer, "I believe if we were not to do
so, you would have very few beauties to admire
in your ride,&mdash;the women only come here to
see us."&mdash;"And what do <i>you</i> come for?"
asked Lord Glenmore smiling.&mdash;"Oh, to shew
ourselves, certainly: to <i>be</i> admired." Before
he could reply to the insufferable impertinence
of this speech&mdash;if indeed he would have
deemed it worthy any reply&mdash;an equipage
caught the eye of Lord Glenmore as it entered
the gate, and putting spurs to his horse he was
at its side in a moment and speaking to the
ladies in it. "Whose carriage is that?" asked
Lord Albert of Leslie Winyard, who continued
to saunter his horse in company with him.</p>

<p>"It's the Melcombe's," he replied, after a
pause, and having put the handle of his whip,
which contained a glass, to his eye&mdash;"it's the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Melcombe's: Georgina is a d&mdash;d fine girl.
Don't you know Georgina? they say Glenmore
is smitten,&mdash;I'll go and see the fun;" and, with
these words, this model of the gallantry of the
nineteenth century rode off. "What can he
mean," said Lord Albert to himself, "by calling
any woman familiarly by her name in that
manner, unless she be his sister or near
relative; but to me, a stranger almost to himself,
and to the party utterly unknown, what
abominable vulgarity, what detestable insolence!"</p>

<p>There is no saying how far Lord Albert might
have gone on in his animadversions on the manners
of his sex, if he had been left quite to himself,
for there was enough around him, and before
his eyes, to provoke remark even in a mind
less alive to the niceties and decorum of polished
life. But his attention was called another way,
and he in turn was to become a subject of flippant
ridicule; to be set down as a person <i>à prétension</i>,
by the young men whose manners he
had very justly condemned, and who chose to
attribute to coxcombry and to affectation, a demeanour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and a bearing which they had not the
power to imitate.</p>

<p>A graceful inclination of the head from some
lady passing in the throng, and whose feathers
waved in unison with the movement, as she
bowed to Lord Albert, caught his eye. He
gazed for a moment, not recognizing the party,
but lifted his hat courteously from his head,
and as he looked back to ascertain better who
it was, perceived the carriage had stopped near
the gate. Turning his horse, therefore, he rode
in the direction, and discovered that it was Lady
Hamlet Vernon who had saluted him. He approached
the carriage, with all the air and gallantry
of a really high bred person, thanked
Lady Hamlet Vernon for the honour she had
done him, in recognizing him in the crowd;
apologized for his own blindness, and continued
for some minutes in conversation with her on
the beauty and gaiety of the scene, and on the
current topics of the day. His back was turned
at the time to the phalanx of horsemen, whose
ranks, and avowed occupation, had given occasion
to his remarks on the bad manners of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
age; and who now, assembled in closer body by
the gate, were ready to give their last glance of
scrutiny or recognition to the departing carriages.</p>

<p>"That's a fine horse that man is upon," said
Lord Tonnerre, pointing to Lord Albert; "who
the devil is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh! its D'Esterre," said Leslie Winyard,
"do you not know him a mile off, by all his
bows and grimaces: for me, I could 'wind him
i' the lobby, any where.'"</p>

<p>"Damn the fellow, what business has he with
such a horse&mdash;can he ride?"</p>

<p>"I should think not," drawled out Lord
Baskerville; "he is the most conceited animal
London has boasted for some centuries. I heard
him talk last night about that dear Sontag, till
I was sick."&mdash;"And, my lords and gentlemen,"
said Leslie Winyard, in mock solemnity, "he
talked not only most fancifully, as my Lord
Baskerville avers, last night, but on this
morning too: and upon what? Divine, O ye
augurs! declare it, ye soothsayers!&mdash;Why he
discovered, in the very age and body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
time&mdash;its forms and its complexion, and pronounced
our manners, rude; our bearing, unlike
gentlemen; our noble array here, barbaric
and uncivilized;&mdash;in short, [assuming his natural
tone] he is a d&mdash;d puppy. I caught him,
but now, preaching in this strain to Glenmore,
who, like a fool, said he agreed with him!"&mdash;A
general murmur burst from the circle which
had listened to Leslie Winyard, and the words
coxcomb, ass, puppy, poppinjay, and jackanapes,
issued simultaneously from the lips of
these polished ultras of ton.</p>

<p>Lord Tonnerre alone was silent, but his features
shewed him to be as little in a mood
for gentleness as any of them. When having
grasped his rein, and put his horse on his
haunches, he glanced a look of intelligence to
those around him, and was off at full speed towards
the spot where Lord Albert, leaning from
his horse, was still conversing with Lady Hamlet
Vernon. Regardless of courtesy, or the consequences
of his impetuosity, he kept his violent
course till within half a neck of the carriage,
and then suddenly endeavoured to wheel round,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and pass on the other side. Lord Albert's horse,
startled at this close and sudden approach,
plunged, and alarmed at the carriages and
noise, became, for a moment, unmanageable,
and broke away. His rider's admirable dexterity
and coolness, however, soon enabled him to rein
in this movement, and return towards the spot
from which he had started, and where his preoccupation
had prevented his observing that a
crowd of horsemen had gathered, who partially
stood round, or were dismounting, seemingly
to assist in some accident. He moved at a
quicker pace, and found that Lord Tonnerre's
horse, on being so roughly checked, had reared,
and fallen back on his rider.</p>

<p>Lord Albert was on his feet in an instant,
and making his way through the throng was
as eager in his inquiries, and prompt to render
assistance to the sufferer, as if he had been personally
interested in him. He found, however,
no serious mischief had occurred. Lord Tonnerre,
with the exception of having been stunned
with the fall, and not yet able to rise,
seemed perfectly himself, and careless of what
had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>His first inquiries were for his horse; and
having been assured by several of his friends
that no injury had been sustained in that
quarter, he swore loudly against the animal
for a fault which had been entirely his own,
gave way to the most violent gesticulations
of angry passion against the curiosity (as
he called it) of the by-standers, and so disgusted
Lord Albert D'Esterre by his want of
proper feeling under an accident that might
have ended fatally, that the latter mounted his
horse once more, rode round to the other side
of Lady Hamlet Vernon's carriage to assure
her that she need be under no apprehension
for Lord Tonnerre's safety, and continuing by
her side as she proceeded out of the Park, left
the actors of this paltry scene to bear their
discomfiture as they best could.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 2em;">"THE OPERA."</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not to be supposed that Lady Tilney
should keep a determination formed fully one
hundred and forty-four hours before the season
of its fulfilment, or retain on the Saturday
evening the same degree of passionate admiration
of the Sontag's powers, which she
had expressed on the previous Wednesday to
Lord Albert D'Esterre, when announcing her
intention of being present at the first scene of
the Opera. She did, however, reach the house,
on the evening in question, before the conclusion
of the third act, and found the Comtesse
Leinsengen already in her box.</p>

<p>"Eh bien, ma chere, à la fin vous voilà! have
you been ever since at dat tiresome dinner?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; I drove home immediately after
you went away; but I had a thousand things of
consequence to do, and could not positively arrive
sooner. Amongst other things there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
great enormous card of invitation from the
D'Hermantons. It is quite out of the question <i>my</i>
going: and I think the affair ought to be overturned
as much as possible&mdash;our cause should
be established without offence directly given,
but decidedly; and if we are engaged elsewhere,
you know, our excuse of '<i>exceedingly
sorry</i>' will always effect this, and save us, in the
present instance, from the extensive and moral
acquaintances of the Duchess, and from the
<i>fadeur</i> of her evenings. I would myself send
out cards did I not think it would be too
marked; but some of us might do so. There
is Lady de Chére, I see, in her box; would you
arrange the business with her to-night in the
room&mdash;Do you agree with me, my dear Comtesse?"
Her friend nodded assent; and in her
abrupt rough voice said, "N'ayez pas peur!
I can always hold up my head and tread <i>down
de plebe</i>&mdash;we are used to dat; but for you, I
fear in dis country, you do not understand de
matter."&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know, my dear Comtesse, I have
often explained to you, that our constitution&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! trève de politiques I implore," said
the Comtesse Leinsengen, turning her head
away, and looking towards the stage: "trève
de politiques je n'en puis plus; but fiez vous
en à moi."&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am surely the last person you ought to
suspect unequal to that task! It is quite unjust
to me, dear Comtesse! Have you forgotten the
woman whom Lady Ellersby and myself
thought we could use? whom we actually paraded
for a season, maintained she was a beauty,
and a person 'qui feroit fureur;' and after all,
when she failed, left her planté in the midst of
the promised honours; actually ejected her
from Almack's, and if we met, walked over her
as a person whose face we had never seen!&mdash;Was
not this carried with a proper spirit?"</p>

<p>"Yes, under my suggestion; but I could
have told you from de first that her <i>grand
nigaud de mari</i> would be always <i>à ses trousses</i>,
and prevent her being of the least service to
us. It is quite a mistake to attempt such a
measure, <i>ça sent le roman</i>, and I do hate all
romance&mdash;Dat young milor, (vat you name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
him?) dat was at your house de oder morning,
Lor&mdash;Lor Albert D'Esterre; I don't think,
upon my word, never I don't, dat he will do
us any good, I have my doubts dat he is only
<i>un espion</i>, and&mdash;" Whilst the Comtesse was
speaking, the door of the box opened, and
there entered, with an air of affected refinement,
a person whose appearance ill suited
with his outward show of courtliness&mdash;his face
was red and large, with grey eyes, his hair inclining
to flaxen, and his whole figure round
and ill-formed.</p>

<p>This physiognomy, however, if Sir William
Temple would have allowed himself to be
natural, was an index to his disposition,
for he was <i>au fond</i> good-natured; but an
overweening vanity&mdash;a desire to be fine,
and be considered one of the beau-monde,
had spoilt the man, and he became insufferably
pompous and conceited&mdash;in proportion
as his exertions in good dinners <i>in</i> the season,
a good country house <i>out</i> of it, and a vote in
parliament, made him successful in obtaining
the notice of people of rank, and of the minister.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
The first thought his cook good, his
chateau, at an easy distance from London,
convenient&mdash;and the last, remembering the
old woman's adage, considered that every little
helped, and that Sir William's vote, so long
as it was on the right side, was as good as any
other. He had made his way thus far with
tolerable facility, but his ambition grew by
feeding on, and was only to be satisfied by
the attainment of the highest distinction of
the <i>ton</i> of the day; such as in his estimate was
conferred by the protecting smile of Lady
Tilney, the Comtesse Leinsengen and others
of that <i>élite</i> body.</p>

<p>No opportunity therefore was lost, no pains
omitted to arrive at this desirable end, and to
improve the recognition with which Sir William
found himself at times honoured, into
what should at least <i>appear</i> a footing of intimacy.
An opera box was an outwork more
easy to be taken by a <i>coup de main</i>, than a
lodgment effected in the citadel itself; and
while unregistered on the favoured list of the
<i>entré</i> at Lady Tilney's mansion, the access to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
her circle in the public theatre, which was not
denied him, appeared a license of the utmost
importance, and one which he was the last
man to let grow obsolete by neglect of usage,
or forget to turn to profit.</p>

<p>"Has not the Sontag outdone herself to-night,
Lady Tilney?" asked Sir William as he
entered the box.</p>

<p>"Yes, never was there such a singer&mdash;I
have been listening till my very ears ache with
intense attention."</p>

<p>"I am so glad, Lady Tilney, to hear you
say so, for I have been disputing the point
with Lord Albert D'Esterre, who maintains that
the Sontag's singing is not in the first style,
and a great deal more of the same sort; but
he might as well endeavour to persuade me
that Ude is inferior to Doveton's present man
Mariné. I think Lord Albert D'Esterre wishes
to be thought an oracle, and the superior judge
of all judges, and that without his decree there
can be no perfection."</p>

<p>"<i>Vraiment</i>," said the Comtesse with a
shrug of her shoulders, "I think Milor might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
suspend his judgments till he heard if people
cared for dem."</p>

<p>"Ah, how delighted I am Comtesse to hear
you say so," cried Sir William, repeating the
words he had first addressed to Lady Tilney,
and which indeed he addressed to every one
of <i>ton</i>, let what might be the subject, or the
sense that fell from them.</p>

<p>"<i>Vraiment!</i>" again came drily from the
lips of Comtesse Leinsengen, accompanied
with a look at the speaker, which told him
that the contempt conveyed in that expression,
when speaking of Lord Albert, attached
equally to himself. Fully understanding the
intended meaning, and conscious that with the
Comtesse Leinsengen he had made much less
way than with Lady Tilney, he turned once
more to the latter, and addressed her on a subject
by which he knew well he should pay his
court successfully.</p>

<p>"You were not at Lady Borrowdale's the
other night. You never saw such a set as were
assembled there; positively there was no
stirring without coming in contact with people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
whom one had never seen before&mdash;and
then it is such bad taste to collect such a
crowd&mdash;for my part, I got away after the first
glance at the affair." Lady Tilney smiled, and
Sir William, encouraged, continued, "Do you
dine at Doveton's?"</p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear you say so. Lord
Osbalston asked me for the same day&mdash;but
Mariné, you know, lives with Doveton now,
and he could always turn the scale with
me" (laughing affectedly); "<i>Apropos</i>, might
I venture to ask the honour of your partaking
of my rustic fare? I am living, you know, quite
<i>en garçon</i>; but it would be a variety, so different
from all you meet elsewhere; so very
plain, and so very humble; and you would of
course do me the honour to name your own
party. Might I hope that you too, Comtesse,
would condescend so far?"</p>

<p>This was the boldest step Sir William Temple
had yet taken; and he stood in proportionate
anxiety, breathless and red, awaiting a
reply which was to confirm or crush his hopes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
May be, like a second Cæsar, he felt that he
had crossed the limits of the empire, and saw
that victory only could retrieve what he had
hazarded, and that he must rise or fall by that.
If victory did attend him, then, like another
Alexander, he might weep for fresh worlds to
conquer; but if he fell,&mdash;"oh! what a fall was
there, my friends!" Such feelings, no doubt,
did agitate his swelling breast when he saw the
interchange of looks pass between Lady Tilney
and her friend, as if they questioned each
other.</p>

<p>"Shall we gratify this man?" (this fool he
would have read, could he have interpreted
the Countess Leinsengen's expression): "shall
we countenance him?" and in the tremendous
moment of suspense Sir William blest his stars
that there were none by to mark him. But
when the joyful sound of Lady Tilney's voice
pronounced an acceptance of his petition, he
would have given every thing, short of the
promised honour itself, that the whole Opera
house had been present to witness his triumph.
"You will receive us <i>en garçon</i>, Sir William,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
dat will be very good," said the Comtesse Leinsengen:
"all I bargain for is dat there should
be no misses&mdash;dose unmarried women are
always in de way."</p>

<p>Sir William was too much intoxicated with
joy&mdash;too much absorbed with the prospect of
his increasing consequence in the eyes of the
fashionable world, when it should be announced
that he had entertained the Comtesse Leinsengen,
Lady Tilney, and a party of distinguished
personages to dinner, at his house in
May Fair, to pay attention to any thing not
immediately connected with the results which
that dinner would produce. He had heard not
one word distinctly beyond the promised acceptance
of his invitation; although he continued
mechanically to reply, whenever he imagined
himself addressed. "I am so glad to
hear you say so!&mdash;I am delighted to hear
that!" At last, on recovering a little, he perceived
that Lady Tilney and her friend had
entered into an argument on the subject of the
unmarried ladies, to whom the Comtesse had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
alluded, and in which his dinner seemed entirely
forgotten, or likely to be so.</p>

<p>"Dey are always tinking of settlements, and
jewels, and have nothing to do but take notice
of what oders are doing," rejoined the Comtesse
Leinsengen, in her most thrilling tone: "Our
way is much de better dan yours; we marry our
children at once, or put them in de convents:
dat settles de matter, and make dem much
happier too."</p>

<p>"I am not quite so sure of that point, my
dear Comtesse," said Lady Tilney, "although
I own ladies are bores; but we manage the
thing in <i>our</i> way, and as well at least: we
let them <i>seem</i> to please themselves, which
is half the battle towards making them satisfied
with the lot they draw, and we ourselves
direct the entire <i>marche du jeu</i>. You know
I am for liberty in all things; liberty of
choice as well as conscience; but very young
people do not know what they wish and
it is only when a little acquainted with the
world that any body can be said to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
choice." Sir William Temple remained in
torture during this discussion, and more than
once wished all the unmarried ladies in London,
who thus seemed to step in between himself
and fortune, at the bottom of the sea. At
length, tired, but not convinced, Lady Tilney
left her opponent in the middle of a sentence,
and turning to the unhappy Sir William,
asked, "for what day shall I make our party
at your house?"</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear you say that!" was
the prompt and very sincere answer of the
person addressed. "Oh, any day you do me
the honour to appoint."</p>

<p>"Dat dinner of yours, Sir William, oh
vraiment je me fais fête d'y penser," cried
the Comtesse Leinsengen, turning abruptly
round to him, and determined that her rival in
argument should not have even that subject
entirely her own.</p>

<p>"I hate vaiting and puts off; we vill fix de
day at once&mdash;vat say you to Sunday? to-morrow&mdash;de
Sunday is always frightful dull in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
your country; 'tis the only day, besides, in
which I am disengaged."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad to hear you say so," replied
Sir William, "let it be to-morrow," turning
at the same time with a look of inquiry to Lady
Tilney.</p>

<p>"Oh, after church there is no objection to
diverting one's-se1f innocently; it is impossible
to read and pray all day: besides I like
to make the Sunday, on principle, a gay,
chearful day."</p>

<p>At this moment Lord Albert D'Esterre entered.
"Shall I ask him for to-morrow?"
eagerly whispered Sir William into Lady Tilney's
ear; afraid lest the subject nearest his
heart should again be usurped by some other
topic.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;yes, you may;" replied Lady
Tilney; whose answer in the affirmative was
decided by her wish to know more of Lord Albert
in society, and a little also by Comtesse
Leinsengen's having held cheap her penetration
in regard to the qualifications of the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
for their <i>société choisie</i>. The invitation
was quickly given, and no excuse would be
admitted. While Lord Albert was endeavouring
to extricate himself from this importunity,
and Sir William to convince him of the
impossibility of disobeying Lady Tilney's commands,
which he advanced to strengthen his
cause, the Comtesse Leinsengen caught the
conversation:</p>

<p>"So, Milor, you will not be at de party to-morrow?
an excuse vraiment! when de people
make <i>me excuse</i>, I know what dat means,
and it is made up in my mind never to ask
dem again."</p>

<p>"When you have once expressed that horrible
sentence," answered Lord Albert, smiling,
"it would surely be impossible to incur so
great a danger; but as I am really not able
to give my assent to the very obliging invitation,
I shall not, I hope, be deemed deserving
of the penalty."</p>

<p>"What! <i>then</i> you will <i>not</i> accept?" asked
the Comtesse Leinsengen again, in her own
abrupt tone of command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; I lament I cannot." The Comtesse
shrugged her shoulders, adding:</p>

<p>"What! you will not accept, I suppose,
because it is Sunday; and you are engaged
all de day long to de Church; is it not dat&mdash;are
you what dey call a saint?" Lord
Albert felt annoyed by the importunity with
which he had been assailed; and conceiving,
according to his own ideas of good breeding,
that declining an invitation at first was sufficient,
he continued to look more grave and annoyed.
Still as the Comtesse repeated the
question:</p>

<p>"Are you what dey call a saint?"</p>

<p>"No, a sinner certainly; but would I were
indeed a saint."</p>

<p>"So den you condemn us all, I suppose,
who do not keep de Sunday stupidly <i>à la
façon Angloise</i>? Vill you tell me now, Milor,
vat you tink one may do on a Sunday? I suppose
you would not hang your cat, <i>par exemple</i>,
if she killed her mouse on Sunday, vould
you?"</p>

<p>Lord Albert D'Esterre looked still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
cold and grave, as he drew himself up and
leant against the back of the box, saying, that
"it was an unfitting time and place for such
discussions, and that he begged to be excused
from entering upon them." Then bending
forward to Lady Tilney, who had remained
silent, and saying a few words to her, he bowed
and retired.</p>

<p>"Il est farouche et fanfaron au possible,"
cried the Comtesse Leinsengen, as he closed
the door; "after to-night I have done vid
him."</p>

<p>"He is only original; and it will be a
great thing to soften his little prejudices, and
teach him to enjoy existence under your
tuition, if it were possible," said Sir William,
making as low a bow as his <i>embonpoint</i> would
permit, "'<i>to soften knotted oaks, and bend the
rocks</i>,' it would be done&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lady Tilney smiled at the mis-quotation,
while the Comtesse Leinsengen added in a
tone of impatience: "but Miladi, do vat
she vill, cannot make a bore agreeable; but,
ah!" turning round, "dere is Milor Baskerville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
how glad I am to have something
humanized to talk to! Milor, we have just had
a saint in our box; do you not smell de odour
of sanctity very strong?"</p>

<p>"I am at a loss to know your meaning,
Comtesse&mdash;pray explain;" and when she did
so, he replied; "Hem! from the first moment
I saw him, I suspected that stiff unnatural
sort of manner had something sinister, (hem!)
I hope I am not worse than my neighbours,
(hem!) but whenever I hear any thing approaching
to cant (hem!) I fly from it, (hem!)
as I would from all that I hold most detestable;
(hem!) besides, since his conduct to
Tonnerre, I have considered him (hem!)
hardly in the light of a gentleman. (hem!)
You heard, Comtesse, did you not, of that
affair? (hem!)"</p>

<p>"No, vat <i>affaire</i> you speak of?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know he nearly caused Tonnerre
a most serious accident, and (hem!) his
favourite horse Chester, it is feared, is entirely
ruined."</p>

<p>"No, I never heard one word of it, vat was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
it for?"&mdash;"Why, Tonnerre (hem!) was riding
up gently to speak (hem!) to Lady Hamlet
Vernon in the Park, (hem!) my Lord Albert
D'Esterre, who was by her carriage, (hem!)
chose to turn his horse short round, and to
shew his horsemanship, spurred the animal,
who plunged and kicked, and (hem!) Tonnerre's
horse was driven against the carriage
and reared, and fell back&mdash;(hem!) and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what did de oder Milor do&mdash;did he
tumble off?"</p>

<p>"Yes, (hem!) at least I believe he did, but
I don't know&mdash;we were all so engaged, (hem!)
in assisting Tonnerre&mdash;the last I saw of him
was his horse going through the Park Gate
like a shot, for he can't ride."</p>

<p>"Baskerville," interrupted Lord Glenmore,
who had entered the box, and, while talking
with Lady Tilney, had overheard the latter
part of this veracious history,&mdash;"Baskerville,
you must pardon me if I correct
your statement a little. <i>You</i> may have
<i>heard</i> the circumstances only related, <i>I saw</i>
them&mdash;and if ever a man deserved having his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
neck broke, and losing a favourite horse, it
was Tonnerre. I never witnessed any thing
like the manner in which he rode, not <i>to</i> Lady
Hamlet Vernon's carriage, <i>but at</i> D'Esterre,
and if the latter had not been the excellent
horseman he is, I think there might have been
more serious results accruing to both than
actually happened. However, Tonnerre and
his horse are quite well, for I met both to-day."
Lord Baskerville had a mode of dropping the
corners of his mouth, raising his chin, and turning
up his eyes, whenever he wished to shew
signs of contempt; but too discreet to offend
a person of Lord Glenmore's calibre, he
managed to suppress them in some measure;
and having heard out what Lord Glenmore
had to say, turned without answering him to
the Comtesse Leinsengen.</p>

<p>"Do not talk more about dat man, I pray
you, I am tired to death of his name," said
the latter; "but tell me, Milor, vill you and
Miladi Baskerville meet me to-morrow at dinner?
Miladi Tilney and myself are going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
do Sir William dere de honour to dine vid
him, and vid our own party."</p>

<p>Lord Baskerville looked amazed, and before
he could recover his surprise, Sir William
himself seemingly confirmed the strange announcement,
by facing round and assuring
<i>Baskerville</i>, as he called him, on the strength of
many a good dinner before, that "he should
be delighted to see him; and Lady Baskerville
too, I hope will confer the same honour
upon me as these ladies." Lord Baskerville,
ere he answered, directed a look of
inquiry to the Comtesse Leinsengen, to ascertain
if the matter were really serious.&mdash;"Oh,
you must come vid me," said the
Comtesse, "I positively vill have no excuse."</p>

<p>"I am ever ready to obey your commands,
Comtesse, you know, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear you say so," cried
Sir William. (Lord Baskerville drew up.)
"And Lady Baskerville?" continued the former.</p>

<p>"Hem! <i>I</i> cannot <i>answer for Lady</i> Baskerville,
Sir William&mdash;but (hem! hem!) I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
certainly inform her of the invitation, and
(hem!) should she have no other engagement,
(hem!) doubtless she will be most happy, and
(hem!) will wait upon you; (hem!) but dear
me the Opera is ended," looking at his watch,
and turning to Lady Tilney. "Oh those
tiresome bishops&mdash;really I wish people would
not meddle with what (hem!) they have nothing
to do,&mdash;we are always now deprived of
half our ballet on the Saturdays." (hem!)</p>

<p>"<i>C'est vraiment ridicule</i>," murmured the
Comtesse Leinsengen: "dere is no country in
de world where dis sort of foolish ting takes
place but in England."</p>

<p>"It is rather an infringement upon our
liberties, I will allow," observed Lady Tilney,
"to turn us out of our Opera boxes at a particular
hour."</p>

<p>"Liberty&mdash;liberty&mdash;dat liberty of the subject
is all a farce, chere Miladi; it is all a make
believe, as I often have de honour of telling you.
Lord Baskerville, vill you be so obliging&mdash;my
schall."</p>

<p>Lady Tilney, however, would not suffer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Comtesse to go till she had spoken to her again
on the subject of their <i>soirée</i> at Lady de Chere's.
"The Duchess of Hermanton's night will be a
very good opportunity," she said; "to let the
world know that we do not mingle in societies
of the kind; all the regulars, as they consider
themselves, look upon D'Hermanton House as
head-quarters, and make a point of attending
like subalterns gaping for promotion; and if we
are there it will have the worst possible effect.
Then again, such as we choose to invite to
Lady de Chere's, will understand what is meant,
<i>sans nous compromettre</i>, and hold off in future
from engagements like the D'Hermanton's.
You know it would be unwise and impolitic to
impart our intentions to all indiscriminately
who compose our circle; but we must at the
same time afford some guide for conduct. If
we do as I propose the affair will be very well
understood, without our being unpleasantly
involved, and the system will answer well,
n'êtes vous pas de mon avis, chere Comtesse?"&mdash;"Peût-être
qu'oui," was the Comtesse's answer,
accompanied by the habitual shrug of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
shoulders; "and," continued Lady Tilney,
"I think there was every one at my house
the other night who ought to be invited. Shall
I send Lady de Chere my list?"</p>

<p>"I will see about dat; but first we must
know if Miladi vil do as we wish. Laissez-moi
faire, j'arrangerai tout ça," and taking Lord
Baskerville's arm, she was leaving the box&mdash;</p>

<p>"But what shall we do about dat dinner to-morrow,
chere Miladi?" she added in a lower
tone to Lady Tilney.</p>

<p>"Oh go, by all means; he is well enough&mdash;will
be so pleased that we may do henceforth
as we like with him, and it allows others
to hope for the same honour."</p>

<p>"Vell, den, I vill go&mdash;remember Milor you
are engaged to me to-morrow." Lord Baskerville
made one of his most refined bows.
"And who else shall we have?" asked the
Comtesse of Lady Tilney.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know; there are the Boileaus
and Lord Gascoyne, and Prince Luttermanne,
and Lord Tonnerre."</p>

<p>"Dose vill do very well; I vill tell dem if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
I see dem in de room. Adieu, chere Miladi.
Ve shall dine vid you to-morrow, Sir William,"
she added as she left the box.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear you say so!" replied
the happy Sir William Temple.</p>

<p>"May this be true!&mdash;O may it&mdash;can it be;&mdash;Is
it by any wonder possible?" whispered
Spencer Newcombe, who had heard the Comtesse
Leinsengen's last words, and now approached
Sir William with affected surprise.</p>

<p>"Come, my master; if so, the great ones
shall not have you all to themselves," he continued:
"I too will dine with you to-morrow.
Lady Tilney, are you of the party?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why, where is the sign now? have ye
e'er a calendar&mdash;where's the sign, trow you?"
Spencer continued saying.</p>

<p>"The what?" asked Sir William.</p>

<p>"The sign&mdash;Believe me there's a most secret
power in that! Court any woman in the right
sign, Sir William, as you have done, and you
shall not miss."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear you say so!" replied
Sir William.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe he thinks you allude to the sign-post
of an inn," whispered Lord Boileau, who
had joined the party, "and it suits well
enough to a dinner-giving man like him."
Lady Tilney now prepared to leave the box;
and taking the arm of the Duke of Mercington,
was followed by all the men who had paid their
visit and their court to her.</p>

<p>Sir William seemed to look with pride on
the world behind him, as he mingled in the
crowd; conscious of the mark of fashion which
would from the morrow be emblazoned on his
brow; and in the hurry of the throng, and in
the quiet of his pillow, the glory of his future
success and progress alike presented itself to
him that night in a thousand forms.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 2em;">THE DINNER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lord Baskerville announced to Lady
Baskerville the names of those who composed
Sir William Temple's dinner party, she was
sufficiently astonished; but felt there could be
no compromise in being present, and at once
accepted his invitation. The affair being considered
rather in the light of a party to Richmond,
or some similar gaiety, several of the
guests went together. Prince Luttermanne
attended Lady Tilney; the Boileaus joined
Lady Hamlet Vernon; and Lord Baskerville
engaged his friend Lord Tonnerre to accompany
himself and Lady Baskerville.</p>

<p>As the carriage of the latter proceeded down
---- street, they passed the church at the
moment when Lord Albert D'Esterre was
leaving the door, after evening service. Lady
Baskerville's quick eye immediately recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
him, although mingled in a crowd of those
denominated the common people; and pointing
him out to Lord Tonnerre, the latter asked,
in his usual tone of command,</p>

<p>"What can <i>he</i> be doing in that crowd?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it Sunday?" rejoined Lord Baskerville,
yawning. "He has been, I suppose,
(hem!) to some conventicle. (hem!)"</p>

<p>"Yes, he looks like one of those d&mdash;d Methodists,
who would ring people to church
from morning to night, by G&mdash;;" (Lord Tonnerre
forgot that swearing was no longer a
fashionable vice) "they ought to be scouted
from society."</p>

<p>"True," replied Lord Baskerville, "I think
(hem!) that it would do a great deal of good
to society, if (hem!) they were all run up, <i>à la
lanterne</i>."</p>

<p>"Ay, hang them&mdash;hang them as high as
you can see," continued Lord Tonnerre; "rid
the land of them any how. There's my father&mdash;I
wish <i>he</i> had them for once in his
hands; there's not a stricter person on earth
than my father; he'll suffer no immorality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
he'll have no profligacy in the family; but if
one of these canting rascals was ever known to
cross his door, or to be found on his estates,
he'd make short work with him&mdash;he'd send
him away with marks which the fellow would
carry to his grave,&mdash;by G&mdash; would he. All
this comes, however, from the manner in which
we pass our Sundays. I hate foreigners and
all their d&mdash;d ways; but they act more sensibly
than we do in regard to Sunday: they let the
people amuse themselves after church. It's
right to go to church, and all that,&mdash;that I'll
allow; but I am sure the common people
would be much better afterwards with what
is fitting for them, quoits, or nine-holes, or
cricket, or something to busy them with, instead
of going to Methodist meetings, where
they turn saints, merely because they have no
better amusement; unless, indeed, it be the
alehouse."</p>

<p>"And there get drunk," remarked Lady
Baskerville; "that would be vastly better,
vastly more moral. When you and Baskerville
rule the state, things will be much better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
managed, no doubt." This was said half sneeringly;
for Lady Baskerville for some reason
was not in very good humour.</p>

<p>"Hem!" rejoined Lord Baskerville; "I
must beg your Ladyship would limit what you
say to yourself. It is (hem!) a liberty I <i>never</i>
take <i>with you</i>, to say what you <i>would</i> or would
<i>not</i> do (hem!)" Upon this a silence ensued in
the trio; when a few minutes broke the awkwardness
occasioned by it, and they found
themselves arrived at Sir William Temple's
door.</p>

<p>Lord Tonnerre offered his arm to Lady Baskerville
as they alighted; while Lord Baskerville,
to avoid the unfashionable appearance of
entering the room with his wife, stopped, seemingly
for the purpose of giving orders to his
servants, till such time as he imagined he
could walk in alone. There were arrived of
the party only Lady Tilney and Prince Luttermanne.
Lord Baskerville, having made his
bow, retired to a sofa, discomposed at finding
that the Comtesse Leinsengen, on whose
appearance he had staked the whole of his consequence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and the excuse of his presence, was
not yet come. Lord Tonnerre too, displeased
that Sir William Temple continued to occupy
Lady Baskerville with the profusion of his
acknowledgments for the honour done him,
and that Lady Tilney appeared too much engaged
to notice any one, stood for some moments
in gloomy silence, when at length Lord
Somerton entered.</p>

<p>"How d'ye do, Somerton?&mdash;glad to see
you," was Sir William's salutation to his guest,
as he held out a finger to him, and continued
talking to Lady Baskerville.</p>

<p>"Tonnerre," said Lord Somerton, turning
away from this brief reception with a degree of
contempt; "come aside, I have something to
tell you;" when a deep discussion on matters
interesting and intelligible to the former seemed
to ensue, since it was productive of a partial
relaxation of the scowl which generally characterized
his face when he felt himself, as in
the present instance, overlooked, or when subjects
indifferent to him, or above his comprehension,
were alluded to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Tilney, hitherto absorbed in her conversation
with Prince Luttermanne, now looked
up, and addressing Lady Baskerville with an
air of protection, invited her to come and take
the seat next to her. "What a vastly pretty
cap you have on!&mdash;do tell me where you got
it; and, my dear Lady Baskerville, if you have
nothing better to do, pray don't forget to come
to me to-morrow night. Have you seen any
thing of Lord Albert D'Esterre to-day? What
do <i>you</i> think of him? <i>I</i> can hardly understand
him yet; sometimes I think one thing,
sometimes another. They say he is a Methodist&mdash;how
extraordinary! if he was not young,
or not handsome, or not <i>d'une bonne tournure</i>,
one might suppose such a thing; but as it is I
don't believe it&mdash;do you?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen enough of him to judge,"
was the cautious reply (for Lady Baskerville
could be cautious where so deep a stake was at
hazard as fashionable consideration); "but I
think he rather affects singularity."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but then you know he will
soon correct that fault when he has lived a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
little longer amongst us. I have heard that he
is engaged to be married;&mdash;do you know if it
is true?"</p>

<p>"I did hear," said Lady Baskerville, "something
about a Lady Adeline Seymour, a cousin
of his who has been brought up in the shades,
and is said to be a world's wonder of beauty,
and purity, and perfection; but the engagement
was an affair of the papa's and mamma's,
and probably the parties themselves will hate
each other in consequence."</p>

<p>At this moment the Comtesse Leinsengen
was announced, and then followed Lord and
Lady Boileau, Lady Hamlet Vernon, Mr.
Spencer Newcombe, and Lord Gascoigne, each
received with that portion and kind of welcome
which marked a well-studied knowledge
of Debrett on the part of Sir William Temple,
who felt himself the deity of the day,
and who, complimentary, facetious, pompous,
<i>affairé</i>, and familiar by turns, according to the
<i>calibre</i> of the person he addressed, moved about
the apartments like some presiding Joss or
Amsterdam Cupid. The whole party were at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
length assembled, the dinner announced, and
the company withdrew to enjoy the very best
<i>artiste's</i> best efforts, put forth on an occasion so
replete with honour and distinction to his <i>employé</i>.
Lord Baskerville contrived to place
himself next to the Comtesse Leinsengen,
whose hand, in her <i>qualité d'ambassadrice</i>, the
master of the feast had shewn his skill in precedence
by soliciting, as he led the way to the
dining-room; a circumstance, by the way, fortunate
for him on his <i>début</i>, for although Lord
Baskerville's arm would have been far more
agreeable, yet the Comtesse would never have
pardoned such a neglect of her grade in favour
of her dear friend Lady Tilney.</p>

<p>Of the other arrangements of the party it
would be unnecessary to speak, and equally useless
to catalogue the dinner itself. It is known
to all that in London, after the first few weeks
of the season, every one's table who gives a
dinner is covered in exactly the same way&mdash;there
may be degrees of excellence in the flavour
and science of the dishes; but the things
themselves are, as the Geneva traveller said of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
travelling, "<i>toujours la même chose, toutes
les villes sont les mêmes, vous avez des maisons
à droite et des maisons à gauche&mdash;et la rue au
milieu&mdash;c'est toujours la même chose</i>."</p>

<p>It is true there are certain critical periods in
a spring season, in which nature's fruits, still
immatured, are brought to perfection by the
fostering hand of man; and on these the deep
and skilful in gastronomy will seize as apt
occasions for a display of superior taste and
refinement; then, and then only is it, as is well
known, that cucumbers are lawful, green peas
to be suffered, and strawberries and peaches tolerated;
but beyond this there is even yet another
point&mdash;"a grace beyond the reach of art"&mdash;the
very North Pole of elegance&mdash;the paradox,
it may be called, of the gastronomic system&mdash;it
is to display these productions when positively
they are not to be got. Happy the man who
so succeeds&mdash;thrice happy Sir William, that on
this day the stars so ordered it, that while London
was yet innocent of cucumbers or peas,
you should be profuse of both;&mdash;that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
peaches and strawberries had not so much as
crossed the thoughts of the most refined, they
too in abundance graced your board. Oh!
happy consummation of those honours, which
from the last evening seemed about to centre
round your head, and raise you to the pinnacle
of gastronomy and of <i>ton</i>. During the
first moments of all dinners a very few monosyllables
are uttered&mdash;a sort of murmuring
conversation then ensues between the
parties nearest each other,&mdash;till at last one individual
more gifted or more hardy than the rest
hazards a remark across the table, and the
talking becomes general.</p>

<p>It was Lady Tilney who on the present
occasion broke the monotony of those half-audible
sounds that whispered round the table.
"Lord Gascoigne," she said aloud, "I hope
you are really going to put down that vile
newspaper, The &mdash;&mdash;, it is a disgrace to
London."</p>

<p>"I should have thought that you, Lady
Tilney, would rather have upheld a paper of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
its principles, and which affords such a proof
of what you always profess to have so much at
heart&mdash;the liberty of the press."</p>

<p>"You must pardon me, it has nothing to do
with the liberty of the press,&mdash;but a great deal
with its abuse,&mdash;besides, the liberty of the press
applies only to politics&mdash;not to private affairs."</p>

<p>"<i>C'est selon</i>," replied Lord Gascoigne with
provoking suavity of manner; "if we publish
ourselves what we do, we court public remark."</p>

<p>"She cannot forget or forgive," whispered
Spencer Newcombe to Lord Baskerville, "that
she herself was once the target at which some
of the severest shots of this paper were sent."</p>

<p>"How?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>"Why, when, for party's sake, she was once
about to take a step.... I cannot tell
you about it now&mdash;some other time," he added,
as he turned to Lady Boileau, who had asked
the same question of him thrice.</p>

<p>"Publish ourselves! my dear Lord," continued
Lady Tilney to Lord Gascoigne, "why
we never do that if our actions attract notice
from our situation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"They should be more looked to," was the
reply of the latter, interrupting her; "if there
is nothing to censure, the satirist's occupation
is gone."</p>

<p>"Vraiment Milor treats de subject en
moraliste, and as if himself vas a paragon
of excellence dat could not err. Pray, Milor,
do you always tink so wisely on vat you do, dat
you never do nothing wrong yourself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, do wrong&mdash;yes a thousand times a day,
Comtesse,&mdash;but when I do, I do not quarrel with
the world because it will not think me right,
nor if it call me a fool or a knave, am I angry&mdash;for
perhaps it is a truth&mdash;at any rate, other
and better men than I have been called the
same."</p>

<p>"It is an execrable paper," said Lady Tilney;
"and ought to be burnt by the hangman."</p>

<p>"It is an abominable ting," said the Comtesse
Leinsengen, "and would not be suffered in
any country but England."&mdash;Lady Tilney
would have interrupted her, but the Comtesse
was bent on proceeding: "I repeat, as I have
often had de honor to tell you, dat de English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
are a people of contradictions; dey talk always
of dere great <i>purité</i>,&mdash;dere <i>virtue</i>&mdash;and den
suffer so quietly all dose vile tings to be said of
dem in de public prints." Lord Gascoigne,
who did not care one straw what was said
either of himself or any one else, perceiving he
had sufficiently fanned the growing indignation
of Lady Tilney by his apparent callousness to
public attack, for a moment remained silent,
amused to hear the topic discussed in other
hands. Lady Tilney loved argument, and for
its sake often adopted opinions which at other
times she would as strongly have opposed.</p>

<p>"If the things alluded to <i>are done</i>," she continued,
addressing herself to the Comtesse
Leinsengen, "they are <i>better told</i>&mdash;I always like
every thing to be told."</p>

<p>"Vid de exception always, ma chere amie, of
vat concerns one's-self," replied the Comtesse
sharply.</p>

<p>"But I deny that there is any truth,"
rejoined Lady Tilney, not appearing to notice
this last remark; "I deny that there is any
truth in any thing that comes through such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
an abominable channel as that paper; all its
remarks are the offspring of impertinent
malice or envious vulgarity, and all its facts,
falsehoods."</p>

<p>"Hem!" said Lord Baskerville, in his slowest
and most imposing tone, "these things have
always been, Lady Tilney, and always will be.
Some satirist or other, (hem!) has always lived
since the Flood, from Lycophron down to our
own day, to lash the vice and follies of the age,
as <i>they</i> say; but in fact to indulge that spleen
which is common to the canaille at all periods.
And after all, what does it signify? Nobody
thinks about any thing that is said of any body&mdash;hem!&mdash;nine
days after it is said&mdash;hem!"</p>

<p>"If I ever saw <i>my</i> name in that d&mdash;d paper,"
exclaimed Lord Tonnerre, while his brow was
knit in tremendous frowns, "if ever allusion
were made to me&mdash;the writer should eat his
words."</p>

<p>"My dear Tonnerre," rejoined Lord Gascoigne,
once more taking up the conversation,
"you would find he has an ostrich's stomach.
But why should such a toy trouble you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"By G&mdash;&mdash;, the writer shall suffer," replied
Lord Tonnerre, furiously, "he shall suffer&mdash;he
shall pay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who," asked Lady Boileau quietly, "who
shall pay?"</p>

<p>"The scoundrel&mdash;the &mdash;&mdash; who has dared
to use my name," answered Lord Tonnerre,
after several efforts at utterance, which his passion
for some moments impeded.</p>

<p>"But you must discover <i>who</i> is the <i>who</i>,"
replied Lord Gascoigne, with provoking calmness
of manner.&mdash;"Junius himself was never
hid so successfully as is this writer. You will
find it fencing in the dark, Tonnerre, if you
meddle with him.&mdash;But I see you are angry;
now take my advice, when you are so use this
antidote&mdash;it is an excellent rule I learned
from my grandfather&mdash;repeat your alphabet;
and that being done, your anger will be over
too." Lord Tonnerre's face moved convulsively
in every muscle, and his whole frame
seemed to writhe under the words of Lord
Gascoigne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"He boils like a pot," whispered Spencer
Newcombe.</p>

<p>"Oh, do not vex him, pray," said Lady Baskerville;
"he is <i>only nervous</i>."</p>

<p>"Mad, mad!" rejoined Lord Gascoigne,
"pray take heed." With many hems and ha's,
Sir William Temple remarked, that for his
part he thought it cruel to delight in mischief;
that to him it always appeared a most uncharitable
practice to wound another's feelings&mdash;and
somewhat rude too; fit only for the
vulgar.</p>

<p>"The pleasure or amusement," he continued,
"of saying ill-natured things is quite
beyond my comprehension&mdash;quite inconceivable.
I remember, when I used to live a good
deal at D&mdash;&mdash; House, there was a rule established
that no one should notice, remark, or
seem to observe what was passing;&mdash;it was
considered so very vulgar to interfere with
other people's affairs&mdash;all were left at large
without account or question&mdash;and the consequence
was, there never was any thing so enchanting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
since the world began as that society&mdash;so
<i>suave</i>, so equal, so gentle, so serene;&mdash;not
a voice ever heard louder than a whisper&mdash;every
one so well amused, every one so well employed,
that <i>ennui</i> was unknown. There never was
any thing to compare to that society."</p>

<p>"<i>De graces!</i>" exclaimed the Comtesse Leinsengen,
as Sir William concluded this effusion
of his reminiscences, "<i>de graces!</i> do not
tell us, Sir Villiam, of <i>vat</i> <span class="smcap">VAS</span>: to talk of <i>tings</i>
gone being delightful is like telling a woman
who is <i>passée</i>, 'I remember when you were so
admired.' De ting to talk of is <i>to-day</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," rejoined Sir William,
taking the Comtesse's last words <i>au pied de la
lettre</i>, "of course the society of to-day&mdash;the
society <i>here</i>&mdash;is <i>par excellence</i>, the most delightful
in the world." A nod here passed between
Spencer Newcombe and Lord Gascoigne, indicative
of Sir William having escaped from his
blunders with more adroitness than they had
given him credit for; and at the same moment
the ladies rose to depart.</p>

<p>"<i>Vraiment</i>," exclaimed the Comtesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Leinsengen, as she entered the drawing-rooms, "I
do tink, as we are de deities of dis fête, ces
messieurs might for once have broken through
dere abominable customs, and accompanied
us; but dat terrible Lord Somerton and dat
young milor Tonnerre would tink, I suppose,
de constitution in danger, if dey did not remain
at de table after de ladies.&mdash;I vonder, Miladi
Baskerville, comme Milor est votre éléve, dat
you do not teach him better."</p>

<p>"Dear Comtesse, not I, I assure you&mdash;it is
quite enough to take care of one's-self; I never
interfere with other people's affairs&mdash;nothing
would induce me to undertake any body's education."</p>

<p>"I believe you are very wise," said Lady
Boileau; "the <i>laissez faire</i> and the <i>laissez aller</i>
is the best rule."</p>

<p>"I do not quite agree with you in that,"
said Lady Tilney; "how could we have a
pleasant or a distinguished society if that
system was allowed to prevail? how could
we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"La! what sinifies dat?" said the Comtesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Leinsengen, as she arranged her <i>bérin</i> at the
glass; "<i>Vos milliners ne valent rien</i>&mdash;I have just
sent to Paris, and then I shall have a <i>coiffure</i>
that will not be so hideous."</p>

<p>"Did you observe the Duchesse D'Hermanton's
last dress?" asked Lady Baskerville;
"she did think it was perfection; one feather
on the top of another, flower upon flower,
flounce upon flounce, jewel upon jewel, till
she was one mass of moving millinery&mdash;I never
saw such a figure since the days of Lady Aveling's
ambassadress' glory."</p>

<p>"Vat sinifie vat dose women do? D'ailleurs
les Angloises ont toujours singé les modes."
In this, and similar conversation, passed the
hour of separation in the drawing-rooms,
while at the dinner-table the subject of discussion
possessed as little interest as is generally
found in society so constituted.</p>

<p>"Baskerville, Boileau, Gascoigne," said
Sir William Temple, as he resumed his chair
after the departure of the ladies, "will you
not come up, and in the short absence we are
doomed to suffer from our fair companions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
let us find comfort in this poor earthly Nectar?"
(Sir William believed his wines to be the best
in creation.) "Baskerville, what wine do you
take?"</p>

<p>"Claret," was the reply of the latter, accompanied
by a look of surprise which seemed
to say, "of course."&mdash;"Did you ever hear
such a question!" he added in an under-tone
to Lord Boileau.</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;he might as well have asked if
one would try Chambertin after <i>Truites à
l'Aurore</i>, or <i>Clos de Voguet</i> after <i>Bécasses à la
Luculle</i>!" rejoined Lord Baskerville.</p>

<p>"Fools were made for jests to men of sense,"
whispered Spencer Newcomb, "and I know
of no one who affords more amusement than my
friend there, Sir William."</p>

<p>"How officious and <i>affairé</i> he was in contriving
this party," said Lord Gascoigne.</p>

<p>"And how puzzled, lame, and lost in prosecuting
it!" rejoined the other.</p>

<p>"He is a most substantial ass," said Lord
Baskerville.</p>

<p>"Tonnerre," asked Sir William at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
moment, and affecting to vary the theme,
according to the taste of the person, "Do you
know which is the favourite for the Derby?"</p>

<p>"Gad, he turns his words as many ways as
a lathe," whispered Lord Gascoigne again&mdash;"understands
all subjects alike, and is as
learned as the occult philosopher of Hudibras."</p>

<p>"And as much renowned for profound and
solid stupidity," rejoined the latter. A laugh
escaped at these words; and as their "ha! ha!
ha!" passed round, Sir William laughed louder.</p>

<p>"Very good that, Spencer, I just caught
the end of it&mdash;the point is always in the tail
you know."</p>

<p>"He caught it," said Lord Gascoigne, repeating
the words, and looking at Spencer
Newcomb; "do you think he did?"</p>

<p>"If it was with his mouth, he might certainly&mdash;for
it is large enough to catch any thing&mdash;and
he is welcome; I give him my jest for his
dinner, it is the only return I ever make."</p>

<p>"And you thrive on your bargain generally,
Spencer, I should suppose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"How long do you think I took from Penzance
to town?" said Lord Tonnerre aloud;
and without waiting for any reply added,&mdash;"Eighteen
hours by &mdash;&mdash;, in hack chaises
too, changing every stage."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> do not conceive it much to do," rejoined
Lord Baskerville. "I remember, (hem!) once
leaving town seven hours after the mail; and
though I had rips of horses, I arrived, (hem!)
at twenty minutes before his Majesty's stage
coach, (hem!)"</p>

<p>"Well," said Lord Gascoigne, "well,
Basky, that is excellent,&mdash;ha! ha! ha!
that is excellent,&mdash;ha! ha! ha!" The abbreviation
of his patronymic was always distasteful
to Lord Baskerville, and on this occasion
he not only felt his dignity compromised by
the license of Lord Gascoigne's address, but
was himself offended by the covert suspicion
conveyed of the substantiality of the fact he
had related; turning therefore away with an
air of contempt, he addressed himself to another
of the party. Lord Gascoigne, however,
was not so easily to be silenced, and exchanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
looks with those who had watched the
scene, added, with very provoking calmness,</p>

<p>"Basky, you were not offended, I hope,
with any thing I said, I meant only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Lord Baskerville, the
corners of his mouth dropping in the exact
angle of scorn by which, as a mathematical
man of <i>ton</i>, he would have described his contempt
of the speaker,&mdash;"not at all, Gascoigne;
I beg you won't think of it;"&mdash;and he turned
again to the party with whom he was conversing.</p>

<p>"Beat&mdash;beat, Gascoigne," exclaimed Spencer
Newcomb.&mdash;Lord Baskerville looked
around with a dignified air, and for a moment
silence ensued, not however without
a wink passing from Spencer Newcomb, implying
that they had gone as far as was advisable.
But Lord Gascoigne was not to be
stopped without a farewell shot, as he added,
"Well, Baskerville, we start at eight, and
breakfast at nine, is it not so?" The latter
again tried to look grave, but obliged at
length in self-defence to join in the laugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
which followed these words, he let fall for an
instant the mask that too often covered his
most trivial actions, and appeared the good-hearted
good-humoured creature nature had
made him.</p>

<p>"Somerton," said Sir William Temple,
breaking the subject of conversation, "do you
remember when you were at my chateau in the
north?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the dry reply he received from
one who, though he eat his dinners, held him
in the most sovereign disdain, and this "yes"
sounded harshly on the ears of Sir William,
living as he did in the praises bestowed on his
establishments, and never losing an opportunity
of referring to the subject of them;
nor was he less annoyed, as he observed a
whisper pass between his northern guest and
Lord Tonnerre, to whom Lord Somerton had
turned after his very short and laconic reply,
and added,</p>

<p>"The fellow had one covey of partridges,
two dozen of Burgundy, and a mistress; I
made love to the one, drank the other, killed
the third, and then quitted."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good," said Spencer Newcomb, who had
overheard what passed; "he would have pardoned
you, however, the first, if you had
praised the others."</p>

<p>"No doubt he would," replied Lord Somerton,
"but on my conscience I could not do
it, and I presume he feels this as well as myself,
for I shall make him give me a dinner the
first day in the week I am disengaged." Thus
fared Sir William Temple in the hands of
those for whom he had lavished, and <i>incessantly</i>
lavished, an expense which, if properly directed,
would have rendered him an amiable,
respectable, and happy individual. As it was,
he spent his money on objects despicable in
themselves, and for persons absolutely turning
him into ridicule while enjoying his bounty.</p>

<p>The party from the dining-table soon after
arose, some having attained the object for
which alone they came, the enjoyment of a
dinner; others who had yet a further motive,
ascended to the drawing-rooms, and after passing
there sufficient time to complete arrangements,
arrange departures, and fix dry points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
that needed discussion for the morrow's amusement
or occupation, took their departure also,
leaving Sir William Temple to feed on the
empty honour which remained to him, of
having entertained in his house in May-fair
so distinguished a party; none of whom, however,
beyond the dinner-living Lord Somerton,
Spencer Newcomb, and one or two lordlings,
ever intended to think more of him for the
future.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 2em;">THE CONTRAST.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the evening of Sir William Temple's
dinner-party, the invitation to which Lord
Albert had declined, he retired at an early
hour to his study; and having closed his door,
he sat some minutes with his head reclining
on his hands, endeavouring to shut out the
frivolous insignificances of many late past
evenings, and to recal those of a very different
description and tendency.</p>

<p>A sweet and silvery tone of feeling analogous
to a fine Wilson that hung opposite to
his writing-table, shed a serene, self-satisfying
sensation over his mind; it might be
a false complacency, yet complacency for
the time being it was&mdash;and he opened his
writing-box, in the lid of which was a
portrait. This portrait represented a very
youthful girl intently busied in copying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
bust, the likeness of himself. A flush passed
over his countenance, his eyes sparkled, and
a genuine sensation of rapture thrilled through
his heart, as he said,</p>

<p>"Oh! how superior to all I now see around
me&mdash;young, innocent, intelligent, the dignity of
human nature is here! Gazing at this image, I
can never err; it would recal me to the path
of rectitude were I ever so inclined to swerve
from it." At that moment a letter caught his
attention; it was still unanswered&mdash;again he
coloured, for it had remained so since the preceding
morning; and such a letter! Now
with an eagerness that would have redeemed
the slight, he actually kissed the opened page;
and previous to replying to it, re-perused the
following contents of</p>

<p class="center">LADY ADELINE SEYMOUR'S LETTER.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I think it a long time, dearest Albert, since
I have heard from you. But then you are so
busy, and have so many things to do; whereas
I have nothing to do, but to count up minutes,
days, and hours; yet this is so wrong, that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
blame myself even for thinking, much more
for writing the thought; and would blot out
the dissatisfied words, but that I promised you
should know truly, and without disguise, what
really passed in my mind.</p>

<p>"After what I heard good Mr. Adams
preach last Sunday, how dare I wish to hurry
on time, when I make so poor a use of it? Indeed,
dear Albert, when I think seriously, I
do not wish it; but when I feel that we are
parted, and yield to that feeling, why then I
am a wayward creature. Does not this prove,
my dear Albert, how cautiously we ought to
look into our hearts, since out of them are the
issues of life? I will do so; I will try to do so,
if God will help me; for it is only by this
watching that I shall render myself at all
worthy of you. Mamma said to me the other
day:</p>

<p>"'My dear love, remember that marriage
is a state necessarily imposing many duties,
and accumulating many cares; this in its happiest
instances must ever be the case; it is
wisely ordered that it should be so. But it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
a state honoured by God and man, and opens
upon a wide field for self-improvement. If
entered upon in this view, it brings with its
pains many delights and consolations, both for
this world and the next; but if it is engaged in
rashly, merely for the purpose of running a
more unchecked career, or for the unworthy
purposes of aggrandizement in rank and fortune
apart from nobler views, it never fails to
produce disappointment, and it may be, disgust
of life and endless misery.'</p>

<p>"What a terrible picture, my Albert! But
I cannot conceive it possible that any body
should marry from any motive but attachment,
and therefore I can hardly persuade myself
that any of these awful consequences are likely
to attend on marriage; only my Bible shews
me the insufficiency of all mere mortal trusts;
and Mamma, I know, never says what she does
not think is true; therefore I must try and
prepare myself for becoming such a wife to
you as will secure our mutual felicity. The
little book we exchanged on the day you left
us, I read morning and evening, and as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
it is finished I begin it again; so when you are
reading yours, you may be certain we are pronouncing
the same words, thinking the same
thoughts, lifting up our hearts together to the
God who made us.</p>

<p>"How thankful we ought to be for good
books; are they not messengers from heaven?
And yet how we slight them. Often, when
engaged in my morning's duty of reading, my
wandering mind turns so frequently to drawing,
to music, or any other exercise, that at
length I have punished myself by determining
not to have recourse to these recreations till I
can moderate my ardour for them, and enjoy
them only as recreations; they <i>ought not</i> to be
more&mdash;all beyond is idolatry. I have of late,
too, engaged myself in active duties among the
poor around our neighbourhood; and my rides
to their different habitations give me such
additional health and spirits, that I am always
ready to laugh at all Mr. Foley's silly jokes.
My heart is so light, and I feel so happy&mdash;I
see no end to all the diverting things I have in
view, and some day or another when, please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
God, I am really your wife, all the schemes I
form for the benefit of those within the circle
of my influence will be fully realized.</p>

<p>"What an extended sphere of usefulness
will then be mine, and oh! my Albert! what
an awful responsibility too will then attach
to my situation! I pray daily that I may be
enabled to meet it as I ought. What I grudge
most is, the time which I am now frequently
forced to lose, in being civil to our dull
neighbours here; and I do confess that to sit
amused by Miss Grimsdale's side, while she
talks over the last county ball, or to listen to
old Lady Henniker's history of her ménage
with becoming patience, is a trial for which
no self-complacency in the idea, that I am
making a sacrifice to oblige others, does in any
degree compensate. But Mamma smiles when
she hears me answering <i>tout a rebours</i>, and sees
my fingers entangling the silks, and tells me
afterwards that we are not to live to ourselves,
and that in fact to please others, when not
neglecting, any positive duty, is a minor virtue.
I am sure she is right&mdash;but, dear Albert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
I feel on such occasions how difficult it is to
be good! Mr. Foley, to whom I expressed
myself thus the other day, told me, 'I talked
a great deal of nonsense, though I was a
very charming person altogether,' and ended
by asking me seriously&mdash;'What wrong I
thought it possible I could do, living as I did?'
How ignorant he must be of the state of the
human heart, not to know that our best efforts
are faulty, our purest actions imperfect! I
stared at him, and then attempted to explain
to him that all our thoughts, words, and actions,
are marked with inherent error. He
stared at me in return, and, looking at me
incredulously, asked 'do you really mean what
you say?'</p>

<p>"'Most assuredly,' I replied; 'can any one
mean otherwise?' Then he looked very grave
indeed, sighed heavily, and said, 'it was a
sad thing to see one so fair and young imbued
with such false ideas&mdash;ideas which in the end
would make me wretched.' I laughed, as I
assured him that it was he that was deceived,
and who would be wretched; that as for myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
I was the gayest, happiest creature upon
earth; and all I had to dread was, loving the
world too well, and seeing it in too fair a
light. I had not a corner of my heart, I said,
unoccupied, or a minute in the day unemployed;
and besides that, my reliance upon
God made me feel as if I never could be
perfectly unhappy under any circumstances.</p>

<p>"But no sooner were these words uttered,
than my heart smote me, for I thought of <i>you</i>,
dear Albert, and suddenly a cloud seemed to
pass over me, and my deceitful heart sickened
at the thought of the possibility of losing you;
and then I knew how ill I was prepared to
yield that perfect obedience which we are
called upon to yield to the will of heaven.&mdash;I
believe my countenance betrayed somewhat of
this self-condemning spirit, for Mr. Foley
quickly asked, whilst fixing his searching eyes
on mine, 'What, is there <i>nothing</i> which could
make you miserable?' and I trembled, and
blushed, and felt a tear of shame rise in my
eye, as I answered:</p>

<p>"'Perhaps I deceive myself, and think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
myself too highly. Perhaps&mdash;in short&mdash;at all
events, I know that I am <i>trying</i> so to feel, and
so to think.' He laughed contemptuously,
saying:</p>

<p>"'I guessed how it was&mdash;poor Lady Adeline!
this false system is spreading fearfully indeed!'
What could he mean? Mamma told me on
my repeating to her this conversation, 'that to
many persons Mr. Foley would be a dangerous
man; but not to you, my child; and I have a
love for that wayward creature, the son of the
dearest friend I ever possessed, which makes
me incline to overlook his faults, and hope
that he will amend them. Who knows but
the mode of life we lead may be the means
of sowing some good seed in his heart? However,
my dear child, encourage not his conversation
on such points.' I believe Mamma
is right, for notwithstanding my dislike of his
irreligious tenets, he is so well-informed, and
so very diverting, that I cannot help being
entertained by him. And in many respects
I assure you, Albert, he is a good man, and
general report bespeaks him such. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
very charitable; is kind to people in distress;
and goes regularly to church, when he is with
us&mdash;is not all this very unaccountable with his
strange way of talking to me? I do not understand
it, and indeed it is not worth thinking
much about, one way or the other. Write
to me, dear Albert, and tell me what your
opinion is upon this subject. I wish in all
things to conform to your wishes, and to
model my opinion on yours: for I well know
your excellent principles and unerring judgment.
To-morrow, I allow myself to return
to the delight of copying your dear bust, '<i>O
che festa!</i>'&mdash;Sometimes (I am almost ashamed
of telling you) I divert myself with putting my
caps and hats on it, and please myself with
the idea that it is very like <i>me</i>&mdash;do not laugh
and call me 'foolish child!' Now I dislike
that <i>you</i> should call me child; remember the
day you receive this I shall be seventeen, so
put on all your gravity and consider me with
due respect.</p>

<p>"The menagerie is thriving; I visit our
pets every day, and you will find them in fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
condition when you return,&mdash;when will that
be? I wish the time were come, don't you?
Good night, good night, for there is no end
to this writing. I must end. Again good night.
Dearest Albert, I am, heart and soul, your
own</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">Adeline Seymour</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Sweet, pure Adeline!" cried Lord Albert,
"how shall I answer this letter." He
seized a pen, and in the first glow of fondness
and admiration, which such a letter and
such a portrait before him inspired, he filled
two pages, not less tender or sincere than
those which had been addressed to himself:
when he was suddenly disturbed by hearing a
bustle and violent clattering of horses in the
street, and at the same time the voices of some
of his own servants. This increasing, he rang
the bell to inquire the cause, and no one answering,
he at length opened the door of an
apartment and called to the porter, asking
what was the matter? He was answered, that
a carriage had been overturned opposite his
door, and it was wished to bring the lady who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
had suffered from the accident into his Lordship's
house.</p>

<p>"By all means, immediately," Lord Albert
exclaimed; "afford every assistance possible;"
and in a few instants a lady was borne
in by two domestics. She was immediately
placed, apparently insensible, on a couch in
an adjoining apartment. The female attendants
were summoned to her aid, and Lord
Albert himself supported her head on his
breast: "Good heavens!" he exclaimed, "it
is Lady Hamlet Vernon! Send off directly for
Doctor Meynell." A stream of blood flowed
over her face, and in order to ascertain where
she was wounded it was necessary to let down
her hair, which fell in glossy masses over her
neck and shoulders. The glass of the carriage
window, against which Lady Hamlet Vernon
had fallen, was the cause of the catastrophe;
and though the injury was not found
to be dangerous, the wound had been sufficiently
severe to occasion a suffusion of blood.
The physician soon arrived, and having examined
the extent of the evil, applied remedies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and administered restoratives to the terrified
Lady Hamlet Vernon, who was shortly after
restored to her senses, and enabled to explain
the cause of her having met with so dangerous
an accident.</p>

<p>"She was returning," she said, "from Sir
William Temple's dinner-party, when her
coachman, whom she supposed was intoxicated,
drove furiously, and the carriage coming in
contact with the curb-stone at the corner of the
street, overturned, was dashed with violence
against the pavement, and broken to pieces."
This account was corroborated by her footmen,
who had miraculously escaped unhurt.
Lady Hamlet then expressed her thanks at
having received such prompt and kind assistance,
and Doctor Meynell having pronounced
it as his opinion, that if she remained quiet
for a few days, she would find no disagreeable
effects result from the accident, and that she
might with safety be removed to her own
house, Lord Albert's carriage was ordered to
convey her thither. "I am happy, indeed, to
think it is thus," said Lord Albert; "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
that I have been of the least use is most gratifying
to me."</p>

<p>This adventure, related in a few words,
occupied an hour or more in its actual occurrence;
and Lord Albert had had leisure
to remark the symmetry of form and feature
for which Lady Hamlet Vernon had been so
long celebrated. He might have beheld Lady
Hamlet for ever, rouged and dressed in public,
and have passed her by unnoticed; but when
he beheld her pale, dishevelled, in pain, and
dependent on him at the moment for relief,
he thought her exquisitely fair, and there entered
a degree of romantic illusion in this accident
which roused his fancy, while her sufferings
touched the friendly feelings of his nature.</p>

<p>As he assisted her to her carriage, they passed
through the room where he had been sitting
previous to her arrival; the candles were
still burning, and his papers lay in confusion
around, the writing-box was open, in the lid
of which was the portrait of Lady Adeline.
Lady Hamlet Vernon pausing, complained of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a momentary feeling of faintness, and threw
herself on a chair close to the writing-table;
her eyes in an instant were rivetted on the
picture, and at the same moment Lord Albert's
hand closed it from her view. There
was nothing that demanded secrecy in his possessing
Lady Adeline's picture. His engagement
to his cousin was generally known, and
his having her portrait, therefore, was no offence
against propriety; but every body who
has loved will understand the feeling, that the
sacredness of their heart's affections is broken
in upon, if an indifferent or casual eye rest
upon a treasure of the kind. Lady Hamlet
Vernon spoke not, but her looks testified what
they had seen; while he remained confused,
and seemed glad when she proposed moving
again to the carriage.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," she said, her voice trembling
as she spoke, "I am afraid my accident
has been the occasion of breaking in upon your
retirement, and disturbing you out of a most
delightful reverie. I shall regret this the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
if it makes you hate me altogether&mdash;but the
fault was not mine."</p>

<p>"Hate you! Lady Hamlet Vernon&mdash;hatred
and Lady Hamlet Vernon are two words that
cannot by any accident be connected together."</p>

<p>"Ah! would that your words were as true
as they are courteous," she replied mournfully;
"but courtesies, alas! <i>imply</i> an interest that
they do not mean. Do not, however, let me
detain you, Lord Albert; it rains"&mdash; As he
still lingered at the door of the carriage, which
they had reached, and in which she now entered,
he added, "You will at least give me leave to
enquire for you to-morrow?" which was all
he had time to say, as the carriage was driven
rapidly away.</p>

<p>Lord Albert returned to his room, with a
confusion of images chasing each other in such
quick succession through his mind, that though
he resumed his pen to finish his letter to Lady
Adeline, he found it difficult to do so; and he
was conscious that the few words which he
added were in such a different tone, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
little in keeping with the previous part, that
he finished abruptly, and, folding and sealing
his letter, closed the box that contained the
miniature, and throwing himself back in his
chair, mused in vacancy of thought till slumber
was overpowering him. Without once
adverting to Lady Adeline's book, he hastened
to lose in sleep the feeling of dissatisfaction
which had so suddenly possessed him.</p>

<p>On the following morning, when Lady Hamlet
Vernon arose, feeling little of the accident
of the preceding evening, and having taken
particular pains with her toilette, she cast a
glance of complacency at her reflected image
in the mirror, and, descending to her boudoir,
placed herself on a sofa, spread with embroidered
cushions, folded a velvet <i>couvre-pied</i> over
her feet, ordered a table stored with books to
be placed within her reach, on which also
rested a guitar and a vase of flowers, and gave
way to a train of reflections and feelings unaccountably
called up by the occurrences of
the previous evening. Lady Hamlet Vernon
was a person who had read, and did read, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
<i>times</i>; but in the present instance, when calling
for her books, she intended no farther use of
them beyond casual allusion to their contents,
and what their appearance might avail to give
an interest in regard to herself.</p>

<p>She lay with her arm resting on a pillow,
and her ears attentively listening to every cabriolet
that passed, eagerly anticipating a visit
from Lord Albert. She twice looked at her
watch; once she struck it, to know if its sound
answered to the hour its hand designated.&mdash;"Surely,"
she said, with some impatience, "he
must at least inquire for me?&mdash;and it is late&mdash;late
for a person of Lord Albert's early habit&mdash;it
is really three o'clock." At that moment
a short decided knock at the door roused her
attention. Her hand was on the bell in an
instant, lest the servants might deny her&mdash;but
in another the door opened, and <i>not</i> Lord
Albert, but the pale and melancholy Frank
Ombre entered. The revulsion from pleasure
to disappointment occasioned by the appearance
of this visitor, and which displayed itself
in Lady Hamlet Vernon's features, was ingeniously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
ascribed by her to a sudden pain in
her head, the consequence, she said, of her
accident the preceding night; which accident
she hastened to detail, and was gratified by the
homage of regrets, most poetically expressed
by Mr. Ombre, who remarked that the danger
of this occurrence was transferred from herself
to her admirers.</p>

<p>"The beautiful languor which it has cast
over your person has produced a varied charm
more inimical to our peace than even the lightning
of your eyes. What a fortunate man that
Lord Albert was, to be on the very spot to
render you assistance! There are some persons,
as we all know, who are born felicitous&mdash;they
please without caring to please; they
render services without thinking what they
are doing, or even being interested in reality
about the persons whom they serve; they are
reckoned handsome without one regularly beautiful
feature, and pronounced clever, superior,
talented, without ever doing any thing to prove
it. But in that, perhaps, lies their wisdom&mdash;one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
may be <i>every thing</i> so long as one never
proves one's-self <i>nothing</i>."</p>

<p>"True, there are such people in the world,
I believe; but do you really mean to say"&mdash;(and
she almost blushed.)</p>

<p>"I never mean, or can mean, to say any
thing that is disagreeable to you"....</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not I who am interested in what
he <i>is</i>, or is <i>not</i>; but, to confess the truth, a very
dear friend of mine, a charming young person,
takes an interest in him, and I should like to
know if he is worthy of that interest before her
affections are further engaged."</p>

<p>"Ah! my dear Lady Hamlet Vernon,"
replied Mr. Ombre, "there is nobody like you&mdash;I
always said so. You know <i>I never flatter</i>;
but you are so disinterested, always thinking
about other people, always so kindly busy
where you can be of any use; so unlike the
world in general, in short, that it quite spoils
one for living in it."</p>

<p>"Well, this is a point we shall not dispute
about, my dear Mr. Ombre, only tell me what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
you know of Lord Albert D'Esterre? what are
his tastes, his habits, his pursuits, his politics?"</p>

<p>"Of himself I can tell you little; with his
father I was very intimate long ago, and I
believe, somehow or other, people do always
contrive to be like either father or mother,
some time or another in their life. Of the
father I could tell you, that there did not exist
a more polished or high-bred man, a term
which you know is not always justly applicable
to persons of high rank; one very well versed
in literature too, at least for the peerage in that
day, and so long as he continued in public life,
no one acted more to the general satisfaction
of people than my Lord Tresyllian. Of the
mother there is little to say, except that she
was&mdash;nay is, for aught I know to the contrary&mdash;a
very good sort of person; who was never
known to make any noise, save once, in her
life, and that certainly was not on a judicious
occasion, for it was when the famous Bellina,
the dancer, was <i>attachée</i> to the suite of her
husband during his embassy at &mdash;&mdash;. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
indeed Lady Tresyllian did make some very
unadvised stir, and contrived that the whole
court should remark upon the subject; but her
husband, who was the most polite man in the
world, as I have said before, represented to
her the inutility of such conduct, pointed out
how such a lady, and such a one, conducted
herself in similar situations; stated that these
sort of things always happened, and were only
unpleasant when they were injudiciously managed,
and in short the affair was amicably
adjusted; an affair which happened so long
ago, that it is only some old chroniclers like
myself who have any recollection of it.</p>

<p>"After Lord Tresyllian's return to England,
he continued to fill several official situations as
long as his friends, or his party rather, as
those are called who contrive to hang together
for some interest,&mdash;their own or their country's,
it matters not&mdash;continued in office&mdash;and on their
retiring, his Lordship retired also: I suppose to
preserve his consistency, or because his talents
were not needed in the new arrangement.
Since then, gout and disappointed ambition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
have contributed to make him a recluse from
the busy world of fashion; and in the magnificence
of his princely fortune, and in the
society of a chosen few, who have shared his
fate, or depended on his interest in their
political career, his existence is now passed,
settling the balance of Europe in his closet,
opposing his Majesty's ministers (as long as
they shall not include his own party) in the
senate, and on every other occasion, and haranguing
every assembly of disappointed patriots
in his own county, of which he is lord lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Of Lord Tresyllian's patriotism I presume
none doubt&mdash;of his judgment and good taste
in politics, from the last-mentioned fact, while
holding his present situation, perhaps there
may be some question. But he has considerable
parliamentary interest, and will therefore
always have some who will think all he says or
does right. His eldest son Osberton we all
know follows in his father's line of opposition;
glad, I dare say, to be saved the trouble of
acting or thinking for himself. I need not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
tell you more of him&mdash;in short, there is nothing
to tell, but his party. What Lord Albert
D'Esterre's will be, remains to be proved; I
mean in the only way people think a man's
being any thing is of consequence, namely the
part he will take in public life. He inherits
wealth from Lady Tresyllian, and so far will
be independent of his father; but he is too
young, I should think, to escape the toils that
will be laid for a young member, and therefore
we shall soon see him engaged on one side or
the other, as a tool of party. By the bye, what
says Lady Tilney of him for that?" Here
another knock announced another arrival, and
Mr. Ombre rose to depart.</p>

<p>"Pray, my dear Mr. Ombre, do not run
away; I should be so delighted if you would
stay and help to keep the conversation alive,
I am too weak to do any thing but listen.
Indeed my poor head tells me that I ought not
to do that."</p>

<p>"I would not stay a moment longer on any
account&mdash;not for the world," was Mr. Ombre's
reply, gently pressing her extended hand; "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
am sure I have talked too much already. Lord
Albert D'Esterre," (for it was he who entered),
"I request you will not be so agreeable as you
usually are, for our fair friend feels the effect
of her accident last night; and I am sure she
ought not to be amused, unless being put to
sleep be called amusement. If I were her nurse
I would prescribe a quieting draught and bed,
as to a tired child; and so I take my leave and
give my advice without any fee: it is always
the cheapest thing in the world you know;"
and he went away at the very proper moment,
having left behind him the character of being
the most agreeable man in the world.</p>

<p>"I should have come sooner," said Lord
Albert, "to inquire for you, Lady Hamlet
Vernon, but I was afraid of being too early;
and I really put a restraint on my wishes in
not being at your door much sooner; for I was
very anxious to know you had not suffered
from the shock you received last night."</p>

<p>"I have suffered, certainly," she replied,
blushing, "but not to any alarming degree; a
day or two of confinement to my sofa, and Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Meynell assures me I shall be quite able to go
about again as usual. In the mean time, here
are my friends," pointing to the books, "who
are ever at hand to entertain me."</p>

<p>"And surely," Lord D'Esterre replied, "there
are a thousand living friends also, alike ready
to endeavour to make the hours pass sweetly;
nevertheless, I honour those who can be independent
of society for entertainment."</p>

<p>Lady Hamlet Vernon saw she had guessed
rightly, and went on to say, sighing as she
spoke, "The fact is, that London crowds are
not society, that the whole routine of a town life
unsatisfactory; and that every circumstance,
depending upon a mere pursuit of dissipation,
is in itself necessarily an alienation, for the time
at least in which we are engaged in it, from all
our higher and better enjoyments; but then
when one has lost all on whom one depended
for comfort, and support, and advice; when
one is left alone, a heart-broken thing upon
the wide world, misjudged by some, condemned
by many, flattered it may be by a few,
there is such a stormy ocean, such a desert
waste outspread to view, that the heart seeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
refuge from the alternative in a multitude of
minor trifles, which leave no leisure to feel, still
less to reflect; and hurrying on from hour to
hour, one passes life away as chance directs."</p>

<p>Lady Hamlet Vernon did not know to whom
she was speaking, or she would have spoken in
a very different tone. She had heard of refinement
and morality, she could even admire
both; but to religious principle she was a
stranger. She paused after having uttered the
last words, and, looking in Lord Albert's countenance
as she waited for a reply, read there a
varying expression, the meaning of which she
was at a loss to interpret. At last he spoke, and
said with deep earnestness, which failed not to
attract her attention, although she was not prepared
to understand the import of his words:</p>

<p>"Is it possible! then I grieve for you indeed."
As he uttered this brief sentence he
took up a book, unconscious of what he was
doing; and opening the title-page, read "Tremaine."
Lady Hamlet Vernon had had recourse
to her salts, to her handkerchief; and
then, as if repressing her starting tears, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
asked, "What do you think of Tremaine?&mdash;is
it not charming?&mdash;Do you know I have
thought the hero was like you."</p>

<p>"I hope not; I would not be like that man
on any account whatever."</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;and why?"</p>

<p>"Why, because I think false refinement
the most wretched of human possessions; and
all refinement is false which converts enjoyment
to pain; nay, I deny that it is refinement;
it is only the sophistry of a diseased
mind, the excrescence of a beautiful plant;
however, the work is a work of power, and its
intention pure, though I do not think it free
from danger. But tell me, Lady Hamlet Vernon&mdash;that
is, will you give me leave to ask you
a question?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Did you ever read the third volume of
Tremaine attentively through?" She blushed
a genuine blush as she replied: "<i>Not quite</i>:
I am afraid&mdash;I thought it heavy."</p>

<p>"You do not surprise me; the mind must
come tutored to the page to enjoy it as it ought
to be enjoyed; and perhaps the fault which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
might be found is precisely this, that those who
would be most likely to read it, are those who
would be least likely to benefit by its perusal."</p>

<p>"You certainly converse, Lord Albert," said
Lady Hamlet Vernon, "very differently from
any person I ever conversed with; your ideas
are quite extraordinary to me, quite new, and
you have made me lose myself in a world of
thought; you make me feel that every thing I
have hitherto thought was all mistake; but you
must allow me to say, that, though willing to
become your pupil, I must be somewhat instructed
in this novel language before I feel
myself competent to reply."</p>

<p>"What I said seems to me very simple; I
am not conscious of having expressed any abstruse
or recondite thoughts: at all events, I
certainly did not mean to be affected, still less
impertinent&mdash;it was something you said, which
startled me, and made me feel concern, and it
might seem to you, that I evinced it with too
much freedom&mdash;if I have erred, pardon me."</p>

<p>"Pardon, my dear Lord! there is no question
about pardoning; but I am curious to
know what made you look so very grave when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
I said I wished to forget my existence, and
lose all sense of what had befallen me, or what
might befall me, in the busy idleness of life&mdash;do
you attach any very dreadful idea to this
declaration?"</p>

<p>"A very dreadful one indeed," was his
reply.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I do begin to believe that
what I heard of you was true&mdash;you are one of
the saints&mdash;I mean, one of the set of people
who go about preaching and praying all day
long. But then you frequent balls and assemblies,
and are so charming, I cannot reconcile
this idea with your air, appearance, and demeanour,
or with the character of those sour,
misanthropic beings: do explain to me this
mystery."</p>

<p>"I wish I were one of those whom you so designate,"
said Lord Albert D'Esterre gravely,&mdash;"but
indeed I am far from being so. All I
can say to explain my meaning briefly is, that I
have received a Christian and religious education,
and consequently that I think to live by
chance, and to let accident sway our actions,
is a perilous state of delusion."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean to say, Lord Albert,
that you regulate all your thoughts, words,
and actions, by some strictly self-drawn line of
rule?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lady Hamlet Vernon, you probe my
conscience, and I am thankful to you: no,
indeed, I have never yet been enabled so to
do&mdash;but I wish I could&mdash;not indeed by any
self-drawn line or rule, but that by which all
ought to guide themselves."</p>

<p>"Well, at last I have met with one extraordinary
person, and this our conversation must
be resumed; but here comes some unwelcome
visitor, and for the moment the subject must
drop."</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by the
announcement of Mr. Temple Vernon. He has
been already noticed as the object of Lady
Tilney's particular dislike from his independent,
and, as she termed it, rude freedom
of character, and he must have been unpopular
in a coterie where studied deportment
and total absence of all nature formed
a requisite merit for admission. But he
was nearly allied by marriage to Lady Hamlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Vernon, having inherited that portion
of her late husband, Lord Hamlet Vernon's
property, which was not bequeathed to herself.
He was first cousin of the late Lord also, and
Lady Hamlet Vernon's jointure being paid
from estates that devolved to him, she had
been condemned to keep up an intercourse
which, under existing circumstances of his
<i>mauvaise odeur</i>, in her particular circle, she
would gladly have dispensed with. She however
endeavoured to maintain that kind of
friendly intercourse with him, which would
prevent any thing like collision in matters
where her own interest was concerned, and
with this view preferred exposing herself to
harsh remarks from Lady Tilney and others of
the society, as to his admission into her house.
"Ah, Mr. Vernon, is it you," said Lady
Hamlet Vernon to him as he entered; "I
hope I see you well?"</p>

<p>"Allow me rather to inquire, Lady Hamlet
Vernon, about yourself; I have made a <i>détour</i> of
at least two miles to satisfy my anxiety concerning
you all. London is ringing with the
terrible accident which befel you last night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Pray tell me all the particulars, and tell me
too who was the fortunate knight-errant that
rendered you assistance?" Lady Hamlet made
an inclination of her head towards Lord Albert
D'Esterre.</p>

<p>"Ah! is it so? well, he looks as if he
were made for adventures," directing his glance
towards Lord Albert. "Now, though I, poor
devil that I am, desire no happier chance, I
may drive about all day or night and no such
good fortune ever betide me as delivering a
lady from a perilous accident&mdash;really, Lord
Albert, I congratulate you." Lord Albert bowed,
as he replied,</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly happy that my servants
were of any use; but indeed I had not the
good fortune you ascribe to me: for I was sitting
occupied in my library, and wholly unconscious
of what passed in the street, till Lady
Hamlet Vernon was brought into the house."</p>

<p>"Indeed, is it so? well, I have heard it said
through the whole town, that Lady Hamlet
Vernon's horses ran away, that the coachman
was dashed from his box, and that some <i>preux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
chevalier</i> had seized the horses in their course,
and though nearly annihilated himself, had
succeeded in his desperate efforts to stop them;
whereas I am happy to see my Lord is safe and
sound. Lady Hamlet, I rejoice to find very
little the worse, and the long paragraph in
the Morning Post all a lie. Well, there is
only one thing to be done under these circumstances,
which is to set the story right by a
counter-statement, and therefore pray do tell
me all the particulars."</p>

<p>Lady Hamlet Vernon smiled, with constrained
complacency, saying, "you may tell the fact,
Mr. Vernon, if you chuse to take the trouble,
which is simply this;&mdash;that on returning home
my coachman was drunk, and upset my carriage;
and the accident happened close to Lord
Albert D'Esterre's door, so that I was borne
into his house, and received there every kind
attention."</p>

<p>"But," enquired Mr. Temple Vernon, who
had listened with evident eagerness to the
recital, "where were you going?&mdash;whence
were you coming?&mdash;for all these particulars
are of importance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! home."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, home! and at the early
hour of twelve?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But where were you coming from?"</p>

<p>"Oh! we had been dining at Sir William
Temple's."</p>

<p>"Ah, and is that really so? was all that
Temple said at the clubs yesterday morning
really true? Did you, and the Tilney,
and the Leinsengen, and I don't know who
else, dine with him? Well, that is really too
good&mdash;why no room in London will hold
Temple after this. He was always insufferable,
even before he was promoted in the
world; and now that affairs have taken this
favourable turn, heaven knows what he will
become; why he'll burst like the frog in the
fable. But I am very sorry, for his dinners
were good dinners in their way; now, however,
they will be intolerable, for they will consist
in every course of <i>réchauffés</i> of what Lady
Tilney admired, or did, or said&mdash;do tell me
how the affair went off."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Temple Vernon, I cannot talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
more to-day; rather I pray you tell me some
news&mdash;how did the D'Hermanton's party end?"</p>

<p>"Well then, if you so command it, let
us turn to my note book"&mdash;affecting to read,
as he counted over his fingers, "Lady Tilney
was <i>not</i> at the Duchess of D'Hermanton's;
Lady Ellersby <i>was</i>, but only walked through
the apartments; Lady Boileau went no further
than the first room; item, Mr. Pierpoint
did not either; neither did Comtesse
Leinsengen, who sat all the evening
by Lord Baskerville, but spoke little; the
Duke of Mercington only shewed his waistcoat,
and then departed: all of which I hold to
be signs that portend dark doings in the court
of Denmark. Now this I think is a correct <i>résume</i>
of the Hermanton 'at home.' As to the
politics of the last evening, it is confidently
stated that the Duke of &mdash;&mdash; has some famous
bird-lime, called expediency, which will catch a
vast number of young birds," turning at the
same time to Lord Albert, "is it not so, my
Lord?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Temple Vernon seems so perfectly
master of every body's intentions and affairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
that I scarcely know, in his presence, whether
or not I am master of my own."</p>

<p>"The fact is, my good Lord, that nobody
knows what they are going to do (if they will
only confess the truth) for two minutes together."</p>

<p>"In one sense that is true enough, Mr.
Temple Vernon, for we intend many things
which we never do, and <i>vice versâ</i>; nevertheless
our will is free, and fortunately not always
under the direction of others to guide it for us."</p>

<p>"Oh! this is becoming too deep for me," interrupted
Lady Hamlet Vernon.</p>

<p>"And for me too," replied Mr. Temple Vernon,
"as I have a thousand things to do before
seven, and it is now past four o'clock; however
I leave Lady Hamlet Vernon with less regret,
knowing she has so entertaining a companion
as Lord D'Esterre." This was said very ironically,
and as the latter quickly perceived all the
monkey malice of the man, he disarmed it of
its sting by rising to depart, saying:</p>

<p>"Lady Hamlet Vernon has far more entertaining
companions lying on her table, than
are generally to be met with among London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
idlers; and not to prove myself one of these, I
must make my bow without further delay,
trusting soon to have the pleasure of seeing
her once more, in the gay scenes in which she
is so fair an ornament;" and again bowing to
Mr. Temple Vernon, he departed before the
latter could leave the room.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Lady, you owe me something,
I am sure, for having rid you from the
presence of that formal personage." Lady
Hamlet Vernon did not look as if she agreed
with him, but forced a smile as she replied:</p>

<p>"I like variety in character and manners;
the world would grow dull, if every one were
cut out on the same pattern."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say that, my dear
Lady Hamlet Vernon, for that is exactly what
I think; and, therefore, I have always held off
from the tyranny, which goes to make every
body subscribe to the same code in manners,
dress, hours, nay even language; and at least,
my coat, my neckcloth, my hair, is all after a
cut of my own, and I find all does vastly well;
for if the world does not approve the one or like
the other, they are at least afraid of me, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
I think for myself. This answers my
purpose precisely as well. But you look serious,
I see, and therefore I will follow my
Lord Albert D'Esterre's inimitable example,
and leaving my last sentence in the tablets of
your memory, farewell, most fair and fascinating
lady. One word more I beg to add,
remember that I wish exceedingly to go to
Lady Tilney's next Friday, and I leave my
wish in the hands of the kindest and fairest of
the daughters of Eve. I <i>depend</i> upon your managing
it for me."</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly, nothing is easier you know,
you are always <i>le bien venu</i>, I wonder that you
can make this request a favour."</p>

<p>"Ah! all that is very well from your lips,
but you know, although I am the most admired
man about town, I am sometimes by some
chance forgotten. It is very odd that it should
be so, but nevertheless it is often unjustly the
case; and I correct fortune by such applications
as the one I have just made to you; and now
<i>je vous baise les mains</i> in the D'Esterre phraseology,
though I would much rather do so in
reality, and so farewell most fair."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Depend upon me," replied Lady Hamlet
Vernon, kissing her hand to him as he left the
room. "Depend upon my hating you most
cordially," she said to herself; as her head
sank on the pillow of her sofa, and she tried
to shut out from her recollection all his ill-timed
<i>bavardage</i>, and to recal the strange but
eloquent converse of the interesting Lord
D'Esterre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady</span> Hamlet Vernon, in consequence of
her recent accident, received society at home
instead of seeking it abroad; and for several
evenings the <i>élite</i> of <i>ton</i>, passed their <i>prima
sera</i> at her house. Lord Albert D'Esterre was
constant too in his attendance there, and was
evidently much occupied with Lady Hamlet
Vernon. His attentions did not escape remark,
and though Lady Tilney's object, in
wishing to possess an influence over Lord Albert,
was quite of another nature, still she felt
some disappointment at finding he was interested
in another quarter, and therefore less
likely to yield to the designs which she had
formed upon his political independence.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how that matter stands," replied
Lord Rainham, as she inquired his
opinion on the subject, "the <i>love</i> is at present
entirely on the lady's side; Lord Albert is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
at all captive, and he has such obsolete ways of
thinking, that I imagine he will not be easily
caught. I should recommend his being given
up altogether, he will never play a part among
us, depend upon that; and you will not find
him worth the trouble of educating."</p>

<p>"Oh! as to playing a part, my dear Lord,
one does not want every body to play a part,
at least not a <i>first</i> part you know; and as for
<i>educating</i> them, that is quite out of the question."</p>

<p>"But," rejoined Lord Rainham, "you forget
there is such a thing as persuasion; and it is
said D'Esterre took his seat on the side of
ministers by some means of that sort. Now it
is possible, that although no <i>liaison de c&#339;ur</i>
exists between him and Lady Hamlet Vernon,
yet as a clever woman, she may have decided
his vacillating judgment; to say the truth, I
believe she has." Lady Tilney bit her lip,
and something like the word provoking, escaped
her, as she replied, "I would scorn to
persuade any body to any thing against his
will; there is nothing I have ever maintained
more strenuously, than that every individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
should have a free choice in all the different
elections of life." Lord Rainham smiled.
"But after all," she added with an affected indifference,
by which she attempted ineffectually
to conceal her mortification, "it is of
very little importance which side Lord Albert
has taken."</p>

<p>"One would have thought so indeed but
for the disappointment which is evident since
he has declared himself," replied Lord Rainham,
drily.</p>

<p>However much Lady Tilney felt chagrined
at the thought that another had succeeded in
turning Lord Albert's mind in a direction
contrary to her wishes, yet she was too politic
to betray her disappointment to the person
who had triumphed; and therefore, on the
evening in question, she paid more than usual
attention to Lady Hamlet Vernon.</p>

<p>"Dear Lady Hamlet Vernon," said Lady
Tilney addressing her, as she took a seat by
her, "you must not pretend to be ill any longer,
we positively cannot do without you;" and
then turning to Comtesse Leinsengen, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
added, "did you ever see any thing to equal
the beauty of her fairy foot?"</p>

<p>This was a sore subject, as the reverse of the
proposition always suggested itself to the Comtesse's
fancy, in respect of her own; and she
pretended on the present occasion not to hear
it, but tossing up her head, took Lady Baskerville's
arm, who was sitting on the other side
of her, and whispered in her ear, "Lady Tilney
does take such <i>engouements</i>, and then is as
quickly tired of them, <i>des feus de pailles</i>," shrugging
her shoulders contemptuously; "but I
wonder she <i>like</i> to dat old story of her
admiration for feet, when she made herself so
very ridiculous in her affected praises of dat
<i>soi-disant</i> princesse. De lady who professes
to worship liberty, independence, and all dat
sort of ting, to sit holding anoder woman's foot
upon her knee, and making all dat sort of fuss,
for my part, <i>je n'ai jamais pu conçevoir ce plaisir
là</i>."</p>

<p>"It does seem to me rather extraordinary,"
replied Lady Baskerville; "but then
Lady Tilney is so very good-humoured, she
always protects every body she thinks put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
down or in distress." This was a prudent
answer on Lady Baskerville's part, but not well
received, which on perceiving, she quickly
added:</p>

<p>"As to myself, I confess I do not take
any pleasure in those sort of out-of-the-way
admirations; I can admire beauty in other
women; but I cannot affect to be so exceedingly
enchanted by it as to turn <i>fille de chambre</i>
in its honour. But there are many things in
the world vastly ridiculous; for instance, can
any thing be more so in its way than that
Duke and Duchess D'Hermanton, who have
been married I don't know how long, and are
still <i>aux premiers amours</i>; one sees them eternally
dawdling about together, as if persons came
into company to be always setting a pattern of
conjugal felicity. It is pardonable, perhaps,
for very young people, during a few months to
fancy themselves vastly in love; but after
that time it is sickening&mdash;don't you think so,
Comtesse?"</p>

<p>"Oui, vraiment; <i>au reste</i> it is only in dis
country that people do give themselves such
<i>ridicule</i>, and to say truth, not often, even here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"But pardon me, Comtesse," said Lady
Baskerville, withdrawing from her; "I must
go away, for I see Lord Boileau waiting for me,
whom I had promised to take to Almack's, and
had nearly forgotten;" so saying she passed into
an adjoining room, and addressing him said:</p>

<p>"Lord Boileau we are very late, and if we
do not make haste we shall be shut out."</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;all <i>that</i> is left out of the evening's
entertainment, I can assure you, for they begin
to be afraid that nobody will go in, though
the doors are left wide open all night."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised, for I hate the whole
thing, and think it is become quite detestable,
only I promised Lady Aveling to go to-night,
so if you are ready let us begone;&mdash;but I have
not made my curtsey to Lady Hamlet."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Lady Baskerville, you may spare
yourself that trouble, if you mean to be agreeable,
for do you not see she is enamoured <i>pardessus
les yeux</i> with <i>that</i> Lord Albert D'Esterre."</p>

<p>"Ah," rejoined Lady Baskerville, looking in
the direction where they sat, "is it so? Well,
every one has her taste; but I cannot say such
a person would ever touch my heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! <i>your</i> heart we all know is assailable
but <i>by one</i>, and that Baskerville is the man, the
most to be envied in all the world; to be sure
there never was <i>such</i> a wife as you are, quite
perfect, Lady Baskerville, only too perfect."
Lady Baskerville cast back her head, and looking
at Lord Boileau with one of her <i>intelligent</i>
smiles, they passed on, and stepping into the
carriage, drove off to finish their evening
amusements in the insipid glitter of an Almack's
ball.</p>

<p>After the lapse of some weeks Lady Hamlet
Vernon was completely restored to health and
beauty, and again resumed her usual routine
of existence. She sought dissipation at all
times eagerly, from habit; but now there was
added to this impulse a restlessness of feeling,
an anxiety if alone, and a void in her heart,
from the evening in which her accident happened,
such as she had never before experienced.
It was in vain for her to conceal
from herself, that she had perhaps <i>hitherto</i> unconsciously
courted the society of Lord Albert
D'Esterre more than of any other person, without
considering how far she was yielding to the gratification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
consistently with any probable chance
of happiness to herself in the ultimate issue.
She certainly had a decided preference for Lord
Albert D'Esterre, or why did she seek every
opportunity of seeing him; or why feel uneasy
when she heard of his acknowledged
affiance to another? These feelings prompted
her to know more of the appearance and character
of his intended bride, whom circumstances
had as yet prevented from appearing
in the great world of London, and to whom
she was an utter stranger.</p>

<p>Under this influence, she determined to
address a letter to one with whom she was
in the habit of corresponding, and whom she
knew to be on a visit to Dunmelraise, the
seat of Lady Adeline's mother. She felt confident
that she might take this step without compromising
herself, and without her inquiries
being deemed strange, or indicative of any thing
beyond a natural curiosity. Shortly after this
letter had been written, the following reply
came from her friend, Mr. G. Foley; the contents
of which were not at all calculated to
tranquillize Lady Hamlet Vernon's feelings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
if she really had any affection for Lord Albert.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Letter from Mr. Foley to Lady Hamlet Vernon.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When one is not to write of that which
one is thinking about, it is the most difficult
thing in the world to write at all. But you
command, and I must endeavour to obey.
Let me see how am I to commence? Perhaps
it is best that I do so by giving you
<i>the history</i>, as one young lady writing to another
would say, of the Lady Adeline Seymour.
You know that Lady Dunmelraise, her mother,
lost her husband and an only son soon after
Lady Adeline's birth; she then fell into low
spirits and bad health, but by degrees roused
herself to live for this child; and I must do
her the justice to say, she has fulfilled her task
admirably.</p>

<p>"As to personal appearance, Lady Adeline
Seymour is of that height which just escapes
being too tall; of that slimness which just
escapes being too thin; of that untutored manner
which is often nearly being <i>gauche</i>, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
it not that it is accompanied by a childish grace
which evades the charge. Quick of perception,
and quicker still in feeling, she has a
peculiar way of checking these impulses so as
never to allow them to betray her into any
unbecoming harshness or abruptness of manner;
the very fear one entertains that she may
overstep the boundary of polished <i>rétenu</i> gives
an additional zest to her, but <i>gare a ceux qui
voudroit l'imiter</i>&mdash;for she is perfectly original
and defies all copyists. As to her face it is not
marvellously beautiful, still less regularly so,
but it is of such love-like paleness, chased by
such sunny gleams of joyous youth continually
playing over her features, that one could
not wish it changed even for a more regular
beauty. She is the very model of the poet's
dream when he wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----'Her pure and eloquent blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one would almost say her body thought.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Thus much for Lady Adeline's appearance
and manners. In regard to the acquirements
and endowments of her mental being, I am
perhaps not myself qualified to speak&mdash;she is
not precisely what the laborious educating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
mammas would call accomplished, but she has
a master genius for <i>one</i> art and a love for
all. Her musical talent certainly requires much
instruction to bring it to any perfection, but
the scraps of airs she warbles as she flies about
the house, are in the best taste as far as they
go&mdash;and a few Venetian ballads which she sings
to her guitar, and which she says her cousin
taught her, are quite inebriating.</p>

<p>"She unfeignedly undervalues all she does;
perhaps too much so; but you read in her
countenance that she is perfectly sincere; that
all <i>spoken</i> praise distresses her; and you are
involuntarily led to seek to give her homage
in some more palatable shape.</p>

<p>"What do you think of this portrait of the
young Adeline? It looks like that of a heroine
in romance, as I glance my eyes over the
words, and yet I have such a nausea at all the
persons bearing that designation, that I would
fain save the delightful one of whom I am
writing from that hacknied name. You must
have heard, of course, that she is engaged to
her cousin Lord Albert D'Esterre; but like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
all those engagements made for people when
they are children, I do not think it will be
fulfilled <i>con amore</i>&mdash;not but what she blushes
whenever she speaks of him, and <i>that</i> she does
pretty frequently; and if he is grown up like
a certain bust (for I have not seen him these
three years, and boys change so from eighteen
to one and twenty), he really must be <i>un bel
Giovane</i>. By the way, she has made an exquisite
drawing of <i>mon beau cousin</i>, but that is
neither here nor there, the fiction of seventeen
is always beautiful. Pray in your next gracious
letter inform me what sort of man he
has become, for I feel a brotherly regard for
this very nice person, Lady Adeline Seymour,
and should like to think she had a chance of
happiness. Happiness, what a sound! but the
reality, where is it?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Come L'Araba Fenicè<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Che ci sia, ciascun lo dicè<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dove sia, nessun lo sà.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I should have told you, by the bye, that
with all the gaiety, which is one of her greatest
charms, Lady Adeline has a tincture of seriousness
mingled with it, which some might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
suppose approached to Methodism; but even
if it is so, <i>à son age elle en guérira</i>.</p>

<p>"I have been a long time here: but it has
been a great gratification to me, and time
has glided softly by; for in addition to the
charms of the daughter, Lady Dunmelraise
is in all respects a very agreeable and sensible
woman, has seen a great deal of the world,
and besides all that, honours your humble
servant with her very particular regard; which
she tells me is bestowed entirely for the sake
of my mother, the friend whom she loved
most in the world next to her own family;
but I am vain enough to flatter myself that
she likes me a little for mine own sake too.
And you, who understand every thing <i>à demi
mot</i>, will know how soothing it is to a sick
heart to receive kindness; this has induced
me hitherto to linger on from day to day;
but I shall vary the scene soon, for I begin to
think that even I may be <i>de trop</i>; for I hear
frequent mention made of Lord Albert D'Esterre's
expected arrival; so to-morrow I set
off for Luryddicath Park. Lord Tresyllian's;
who, you know, is father to Lord Albert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"And now, my dear Lady Hamlet Vernon,
having given you the particulars you required,
I will not weary you with more of myself:
but in pity to me, seeing that I am still for a
time cut off from that only tolerable place in
England, London, do write me a brief, gracious
missive, that I may feast upon it till I
am once more restored to your presence, and
in the mean while believe me to be the most
devoted of your slaves. Can I say more?</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 1em;">"<span class="smcap">G. Foley.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lady Hamlet Vernon, after perusing this
letter, fell into a deep train of reflection, if
such can be called intense feeling usurping
the mind, to the exclusion of every other idea.
The image of Lady Adeline, thus vividly pourtrayed
by Mr. Foley's pen, stood in actual presence
before her; and combined with that
image, rose the vision of Lord Albert D'Esterre.
The happiness which would be the
growth of an union between two such persons
as her knowledge of the one, and her fancied
knowledge of the other, represented them, was
embodied with forcible reality, and tears coursed
each other involuntarily down her cheeks as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
she sat, more like a marble image than a living
being.</p>

<p>From this state she was suddenly roused by
the servants announcing Lord Albert D'Esterre
himself; and making an effort to subdue
the feeling which either she was too much
ashamed, or too proud to own, she endeavoured
to receive him with as much composure as
she could assume. After the first words of
course had passed, Lady Hamlet Vernon was
too deeply absorbed in one subject for her
readily to turn to any indifferent topic; and she
at length addressed Lord Albert on the subject
of her solicitude, saying, "Do you know I have
received a letter this morning full of the praises
of a person, in whom I believe you are much
interested; it is from a friend of mine now
staying at Dunmelraise, and who draws such
a picture of the charms of Lady Adeline Seymour,
that I wonder, Lord Albert, to see you
here&mdash;but you are going to Dunmelraise, are
you not, immediately?" Her tears almost
flowed afresh as she pronounced these words;
and unconsciously she cast a look of tender
intreaty on Lord Albert. The latter had involuntarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
started, coloured, and hesitated to
reply to this unexpected question; at length
he answered:</p>

<p>"No, not immediately; I am unable to
leave town yet."</p>

<p>"You are not in love," Lady Hamlet Vernon
exclaimed, "no, you are <i>not</i> in love with
Lady Adeline Seymour&mdash;I read your heart in
the measured calmness of your words; she is
<i>not</i> the mistress of your affections."</p>

<p>The sentence seemed to have escaped Lady
Hamlet Vernon's lips without the power of
control, in a moment of excitement; and her
eyes, which had been fixed on Lord Albert,
now as suddenly fell beneath his gaze as he
exclaimed with astonishment,</p>

<p>"What can you mean, what <i>do</i> you mean,
Lady Hamlet Vernon?" At that moment
Lady Tilney was announced, and a minute
after Lord Gascoigne. Conversation became
general; but Lord Albert, evidently labouring
under some painful feeling, took no part in
it. Still he seemed determined to remain, to
await the departure of the others, when Lady
Tilney proposed to Lady Hamlet Vernon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
accompany her to the Park; and the latter,
fearing that she had compromised herself in
the too open expression of her feelings relative
to Lord Albert and Lady Adeline Seymour,
availed herself of the opportunity to avoid
any renewal of the theme. With a heart
ill at ease, she prepared to attend Lady
Tilney to the dazzling throng of Hyde Park;
while Lord Albert, seeing it was vain to look
for any explanation of Lady Hamlet Vernon's
extraordinary address to him at the moment,
reluctantly handed her to Lady Tilney's carriage;
and, trusting to some future opportunity
to ask an explanation, he mounted his horse
and rode off; but not with a mind so tranquil
or a heart so buoyant as he had possessed a
short time before.</p>

<p>In proposing to take Lady Hamlet Vernon
to the Park, Lady Tilney's real object was to
withdraw her from Lord Albert, whose anxiety
had not escaped her observation, and whose
political career she still had hopes might not
be positively decided; at any rate, if hope
remained, it was worth the trial; and should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
she have been correct in her idea that Lord
Albert had not committed himself irrevocably,
no time was to be lost; that very moment perhaps
he waited only the voice of Lady Hamlet's
influence, to decide his wavering intentions.
Lady Tilney's part was therefore quickly
taken; and as they proceeded to the Park, she
endeavoured to turn Lady Hamlet Vernon's
mind from Lord Albert, if he really occupied
any share in it, by adverting to every topic of
the day; among other things she said:</p>

<p>"What do you think! Miss Melcomb's
marriage with Lord Glenmore is at length declared.
I had long had my suspicions that it
would be so; but I cannot say I approve of
the affair; and I am sure you will think with
me, Lord Glenmore is too great a card to be
played by that little miss, who has never left
her mamma's wing; and has, of course, imbibed
all her prejudices. But although Lord
Glenmore has allied himself with this family,
we must not wholly give him up; besides the
Georgina is pretty, and she may yet not prove
quite such a simpleton as she looks." Lady Tilney,
however, in vain endeavoured to interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Lady Hamlet Vernon in any subject she discussed;
the former acquiesced in every thing
her companion said, in order to avoid the argument
which would have followed any dissent
from her opinion. Lady Hamlet Vernon's
remarks, when she made any, were short, and
little to the purpose; and at length, wearied
and ill at ease, she complained of a head-ache,
and besought Lady Tilney to set her down at
home.</p>

<p>When the carriage-door closed, Lady Tilney
flung herself back, exclaiming as she drew
up the glass, "How provokingly discreet, she
did not once commit herself!" and Lady Tilney
drove once more back to the Park, in the hope
of seeing Lord Albert; and if possible, by courting
his attention, of counteracting any influence
which might have been exercised on his opinion
by Lady Hamlet Vernon. She looked,
however, in vain for him in the crowd; and at
length drove home, disappointed and displeased
at her want of success, and out of humour with
every thing.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 2em;">FASHIONABLE FRIENDSHIP.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Lord</span> Glenmore's marriage soon became the
subject of general conversation. The day of
the nuptials was already named, and the ceremony
was to be in the most splendid style.
In compliment to Lord Glenmore, several of
his acquaintance were invited. Amongst these
was Lady Tilney and Lady Tenderden; the
Comtesse Leinsengen of course; and Lady
Ellersby, who on her mother's side was related
to the family of the Melcombs. The parties
named expressed themselves annoyed at the
idea of forming part of what they called the
<i>Melcomb mélange</i>; but a secret wish to retain
an influence with Lord Glenmore, whose marriage
it was intended should not, without a
trial of Miss Melcomb's aptitude for <i>ton</i>,
banish him from their circle.</p>

<p>The whole affair, however, was <i>sotto sugezione</i>
in the opinion of Lady Tilney and her friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
"The strangest thing of all is," exclaimed the
former, as she was conversing on the subject
with Lady Tenderden and the Comtesse Leinsengen,
"that the marriage takes place in
church."</p>

<p>"In church! <i>quelle idée, vraiment on mourra
de froid</i>."</p>

<p>"And pray how must one be dressed?" inquired
Lady Tenderden.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>en costume de traineau</i>, I presume,
since it is in von of your cold church; but vat
sinifies how von dresses for it?"</p>

<p>"If it rains I really must send my excuse,"
said Lady Tilney, who wanted to be on a level
at least with the Comtesse in impertinence.
"Have you seen the <i>trousseau</i>?" she added.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," replied Lady Tenderden.
Lady Tilney looked blank; she could not bear
that others should precede her even in the
inspection of a <i>trousseau</i>. Lady Tenderden,
continued:&mdash;"Madame Duval brought me
every thing that was worth seeing; the laces
are magnificent, and the <i>corbeille de noces</i>, and
every thing is in good taste. But here is Lady
Ellersby," exclaimed Lady Tenderden, glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to break off from a subject which had been disagreeable
to her, "I do not suppose <i>she</i> will
approve of the programme of this ceremony."</p>

<p>"My dear Lady Ellersby," the ladies all
exclaimed, running up to her, "why did you
not exert your influence with Lady Melcomb
to prevent this <i>baroque</i> fancy of being married
in church; surely your relationship would
have authorized your good advice on the occasion."
Lady Ellersby looked surprised, and
asked an explanation.</p>

<p>"Do you not know," answered Lady Tilney,
"that the ceremony is to take place in a
church?"</p>

<p>"La! does it? What a strange fancy!"
drawled Lady Ellersby; "but I should never
think of giving any advice to Lady Melcomb&mdash;I
never do, to any body."</p>

<p>"Dat Mademoiselle Melcomb, vid all her
imbecile <i>niaiserie</i>, seems not to have played her
part amiss."</p>

<p>"I think she will turn out better than one
could have supposed," rejoined Lady Tenderden,
"when she becomes <i>un peu plus façonné</i>."</p>

<p>"Do tell me who are the invited?" interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Lady Tilney, addressing Lady Ellersby.</p>

<p>"Oh, half London, to be sure; such a quantity
of tiresome relations, and so much property,
and family dignity, there will be no
end of all the cousins&mdash;don't you know they
are just the sort of people who teem with relations?"</p>

<p>"But who is there of the party that one
knows?" replied Lady Tilney.</p>

<p>"Oh, there are ourselves, and the Duke of
Mercington, and the Boileaus, and Baskervilles,
I believe; I fancy too the Duke and Duchess
D'Hermanton, and some of <i>that</i> set, are also
among the <i>priés</i>, but I must go now <i>en qualité de
cousine</i>, and leave my card with the Melcombs,
and then I shall go on to Kitchener's, who has
the resetting of the family diamonds. I am
told they are magnificent; and I should so like
to persuade Lord Ellersby to let mine be reset
too, I have had them three years in their present
form, and am so tired of them as they are&mdash;he,
he, he!&mdash;well&mdash;adieu, we shall meet to-night
at Lady De Chere's?"</p>

<p>"<i>Avouez moi qu'elle passe la permission qu'ou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
a d'être bête</i>," observed Lady Tenderden, as she
left the room.</p>

<p>"May be so, but she is a very old friend of
mine, and besides, she is perfectly <i>comme il
faut</i>, and after all, that sort of thing gets
on in the world just as well as talent."</p>

<p>"Perhaps better," rejoined Lady Tilney.</p>

<p>"<i>Précisement</i>," said the Comtesse Leinsengen,
"but, <i>il faut que je pars, je vais voir le
trousseau</i>, for oderwise I shall have nothing to
say to Lady Baskerville, who goes vid me to-night
to de Opera. <i>Adieu les belles, adieu.</i>"</p>

<p>"I wonder how she can be at the trouble of
going to see that foolish <i>trousseau</i>," exclaimed
Lady Tilney, as soon as she was out of hearing.
"She is so <i>inconséquente</i>. Did Lady Ellersby
name the Baskervilles as being among the invited?"
continued Lady Tilney.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, the Comtesse, depend upon it, has
taken care they shall be asked; and my Lord
is always flattered in being reckoned a requisite
appendage to a woman of high rank; but he will
soon find his error in depending on her smiles,
for except for the gratification of the moment's
vanity, she seeks no further aim, and at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
times scruples not to sacrifice her <i>çi-devant</i>
friends to her new ones."</p>

<p>"Poor Lord Baskerville," replied Lady
Tilney, "was intended to be by nature <i>le bon
enfant</i>, which she calls him; but he has fallen
into the terrible mistake of thinking himself a
<i>leader</i> of <i>ton</i>, which gives him a ridicule that
he would not otherwise have."</p>

<p>"How well you read characters, my dear
Lady Tilney! But I thought he was a <i>protégé</i>
of yours."</p>

<p>"Oh, so he is; I like him of all things;
and he is often vastly useful. One must have
different characters at command to fill different
parts, or else nothing that one wants would go
on. But to return to the Melcombs, I do not recover
from my surprise about that marriage."</p>

<p>"It only shews what perseverance will do,
I wished to talk the matter over with you, and
to ascertain whether or not you meant to attend;
so now I need not trouble you longer.
Your gown you say is to be rose-colour, mine
shall be jonquille."</p>

<p>"Ah, you always look divine in that golden
light: but what light do you not look divine in?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must positively run away, or you will
quite turn my head with flattery. Adieu,
adieu," and they parted well pleased with each
other.</p>

<p>When Lady Ellersby stopped at Lady Melcomb's
door, where she had intended only to
leave her card, a multiplicity of people on the
same errand <i>faisoit queue à la porte</i>; but to her
infinite dismay, just as her carriage drove up,
Lord Glenmore, who happened to be coming
out of the door, approached her with a countenance
beaming happiness.</p>

<p>"I am sure Georgina will be at home to
<i>you</i>; do allow me to hand you out of your
carriage."</p>

<p>"Not for the world, I would not intrude; I
am sure Miss Melcomb has a thousand things
to do, and to arrange; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, dear Lady Ellersby," continued Lord
Glenmore, pressingly (who thought every one
must be as anxious to see his bride, as he was
eager she should be seen), "Georgina will be
so disappointed if you do not go up stairs, that
I must entreat you will." And in short, for
once, what between curiosity to look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
bridal paraphernalia, and a sort of awkwardness
to do a decided thing, and say no, Lady
Ellersby's indolence was overcome, and she
allowed herself to be handed up stairs into the
drawing room, where were assembled a host of
ladies (<i>not</i> Miss Melcomb), who were busily
engaged admiring the various dresses and
finery which were displayed before them.</p>

<p>"You are just come in time, Lady Ellersby,"
exclaimed Lady Aveling, "for after to-day,
nobody is to be admitted."</p>

<p>"No? well, la! I am glad then; but my dear
Lady Melcomb I came, I assure you, expressly
to wish you joy, and to leave my congratulations
also with Miss Melcomb, whom I hope, I am
to see, for Lord Glenmore insisted on my coming
in, otherwise I would not have done so&mdash;knowing
how tiresome visitors are at such a
moment; but since I am here, do me the
favour to mention to Miss Melcomb, how very
happy I am to have the opportunity of wishing
her joy."</p>

<p>"And do look," cried Lady Aveling, "at
this enchanting hat; it is just come from Paris&mdash;was
there ever any thing <i>de meilleur gôut</i>?&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
then look at this, and that <i>seduisante</i>&mdash;really,
Lady Melcomb, your selection has been
exquisite. But here comes the bride."</p>

<p>Then ensued kisses, curtseys, and congratulations,
during which Lord Glenmore retired,
wearied with the nonsense of the female coterie,
and despairing of even catching a glance
from Miss Melcomb.</p>

<p>While the marriage ornaments continued to
absorb the attention of the other visitors, Miss
Melcomb took Lady Ellersby aside to shew
her what, she said, was infinitely better worth
looking at&mdash;a miniature of Lord Glenmore.</p>

<p>"So, my dear," said Lady Ellersby, "you
are really what they call in love? he, he, he!"</p>

<p>"I am fondly attached to Lord Glenmore,
and feel proud now in declaring it;&mdash;it has become
my happy duty," replied Miss Melcomb.</p>

<p>"Duty!" replied Lady Ellersby, opening
her mouth, and <i>ouvrant des grands yeux</i>, "he,
he, he!&mdash;surely you are not serious? Whoever
heard a young person going to be married,
that is, going to be her own mistress, talk of
duty! Tell me, really are you not delighted at
the idea of having horses and equipages, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
doing exactly what you like, and going out
every where you please? That was what I liked
and thought of, when I was going to be married,
and&mdash;&mdash;but then I was not in love&mdash;he,
he, he!"</p>

<p>"No?" replied Miss Melcomb, somewhat
astonished.</p>

<p>"Certainly not&mdash;he, he, he!"</p>

<p>"I have no wish," rejoined Miss Melcomb,
"to be more my own mistress than I am at
present. I shall, on the contrary, feel myself
less at liberty, for of course a married woman
has a thousand things to think of which a girl
has not."</p>

<p>"La, my dear, you talk in a way which it is
very right to teach children, but when people
act for themselves they think very differently.
Every body, you know, marries to avoid being
governed."</p>

<p>"I never could have married for that reason,
for I have been the happiest of creatures at
home."</p>

<p>"Well really, la! you don't say so! But
now you will have an opera box, jewels, equipages,
and all sorts of delightful things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;perhaps if Lord Glenmore
intends I should&mdash;"</p>

<p>"La, how droll you are; you don't really
mean to set out by asking his leave, or consulting
him on such trifling subjects as these, my
dear child, he, he, he! you are enough to
spoil any husband.&mdash;Well, good morning&mdash;you
must correct yourself of such <i>enfantillage</i>&mdash;remember
what I say. Six months will not
have elapsed before you recant all this, and
change your present mode of thinking and
feeling."</p>

<p>Miss Melcomb smiled, and shook her head
in token of dissent. "Good morning," Lady
Ellersby repeated, "I have already intruded
too much upon your time; I shall be delighted
to cultivate your society when you come back
a gay bride; and pray tell Lady Melcomb I
will not torment her any more just now.&mdash;Once
again accept my congratulations, and my
best compliments to Lord Melcomb, he, he,
he!"</p>

<p>It is a strange thing that in the happiest of
times there is often a word spoken, or a thing
occurs, which seems to interpose a dark spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
upon the brightness of happiness, as though
we were not to forget the nature of mortal
felicity. Lady Ellersby's words, of six months
will not elapse ere you have changed your
present feelings&mdash;sounded in Miss Melcomb's
ears long after they had been spoken; and
though she strove to drive them from her remembrance,
they remained fixed there like a
warning which she was not to disregard&mdash;a
foreboding of evil (for to the happy all change
has terror in it). Minor circumstances such as
this, have happened to every body in their
course through life, and have been like visions
which opened a vista to futurity.</p>

<p>The day at length came which was to unite
Miss Melcomb with Lord Glenmore, and the
various persons invited met at Lord Melcomb's
house, from whence their carriages followed in
the suite of that of the bride's. The ceremony
took place in St. James's Chapel, and it was a
beautiful sight to see the bride, with composed
bashfulness, in the long white robe and coronal
that bound her veiled brows, so fitly emblematic
of her own purity, supported by her
father to the altar, and given from the paternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
arms into those of a husband, who was henceforth
to be all the world to her, and whom she
acknowledged to be lord of her affections in the
seriousness of true and deep attachment, as the
chosen of her heart. Her velvet prayer book
in one hand&mdash;the other folding her veil across
her person, which it but partially concealed,
she knelt down in that spirit of piety which
hallows and sanctifies the vows she was about
to take. The previous tremor which had
shook her frame as she advanced to the altar,
was stilled into composure as she bent the knee,
and raised her thoughts to heaven.</p>

<p>Lord Glenmore, too, seemed imbued with
the same devout feelings, and all those who
came with lighter thoughts, appeared, outwardly
at least, impressed.</p>

<p>When the ceremony closed, the now Lady
Glenmore knelt before her parents, and as they
pressed her to their breast, blessed her with
silent fervour; and even the most insensible acknowledged
a touch of feeling at this scene.
Lady De Chere was heard to say, that she had
no idea it would be made such a serious affair of;
had she known it, she certainly would not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
been present. Congratulations having been
offered on every side, some with sincere goodwill,
but the greater part with common-place
phrase; the marriage party returned to Lady
Melcomb's, where a breakfast had been prepared.</p>

<p>"What a <i>mélange</i> of persons!" observed
Lady Ellersby, as she stopped in the door-way
on entering, in order to reconnoitre. "If I
had not been obliged" (she whispered to Lady
Tilney), "nothing should have brought me
here."</p>

<p>"And <i>I</i> most indubitably should not have
come," replied the latter, "had it not been to
<i>oblige you</i>; and after all I would have given a
great deal that I <i>had not</i>: for I assure you, my
dear, as soon as the affair of the day is over,
we must none of us be seen here again; what
we may do respecting Lord and Lady Glenmore,
<i>reste a savoir</i>. But yonder is Lady Baskerville
and Lady Tenderden, let us join them,
and by keeping as much as possible together,
and talking to no one but in our own circle,
shew that we are not here even at present on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
familiar footing." Lady Baskerville was conversing
with Lady Tenderden on one of those
square Ottomans <i>dos-a-dos</i>, with their several
cavaliers by them, Lord Tonnerre, Lord Gascoigne,
Lord Boileau, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Well I am sure," said Lady Baskerville,
addressing Lord Boileau, "if I were Lady
Glenmore, I should heartily wish all this <i>étiquette
de noces</i> was over; when a marriage has
taken place, and it is known to all the world,
the amusement is ended, and there is nothing
to be wished for, but the comfortable arrangement
of two sensible persons, who know what
it is to live without being <i>a charge</i> to each
other."</p>

<p>"To be sure," replied Lord Boileau, "I
wonder how people can make this sort of fuss
and <i>étalage</i>; it is assuming that one is interested
for them&mdash;nobody cares whether any
body is happy or miserable, and it is a bad
taste to <i>affiché</i> their private feelings in this
public manner."</p>

<p>At this moment a general movement in one
of the apartments attracted every body's attention.&mdash;"Lord
Melcomb is dead!" "Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Melcomb is dying!" resounded in audible
whispers.</p>

<p>"Call my carriage."&mdash;"How shocking."&mdash;"I
would not be in the room with a corpse
for the world."&mdash;"Do let us get away."</p>

<p>"Who knows but it may be catching&mdash;how
fortunate for Glenmore," said Lord Boileau,
looking over the people's heads, as he beheld
Lord Melcomb apparently lifeless. "He will
have the pretty heiress and her fortune at the
same moment."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked some one who
stood near.</p>

<p>"Why, only if the old Lord dies, that Miss
Melcomb becomes immediate mistress of Melcomb
Park, and an estate of ten thousand a year."</p>

<p>"Does she! you do not mean so; had I
known that, I would have proposed to the girl
myself," said Lord Tonnerre.</p>

<p>"But is he really in an apoplectic fit?" said
another.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but sometimes people do outlive
these sort of things, and walk about
quite gaily many years."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! there is that chance to be sure," said
Lady Baskerville, laughing. It is lamentable
to remark, how those who live in fashion's
fooleries become actually indifferent to every
thing, and to every circumstance, of what
mighty moment soever, that does not immediately
concern their interests and pleasures.
The most tremendous events, the most awful
dispensations, the most surprising occurrences
are to them so many little coloured bubbles,
that seem to blow about for their amusement,
or targets set up to shoot jokes at. Life and
death seem but as foot-balls for these puppets
to play with: it would be laughable if it were
not horrible.</p>

<p>Lord Melcomb had only a fainting fit, occasioned
by over fatigue, and the heat of the
room. The brilliant crowd, however, which
were assembled at his house, fled in dismay on
the first alarm of sickness or of sorrow; and
their inquiries the next day for his health, were
influenced more by curiosity, than by any
feeling of humanity, or any real care whether
he were alive or dead. This event, however,
had a very different effect on the minds of Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Melcomb's sincere friends, who waited with
anxiety to learn the effects of this sudden illness.
On Lady Glenmore's mind it cast a cloud, which
seemed to overshadow the bright dawning of
her happiness; and she trembled at the idea of
some unknown calamity, an idea which had once
before visited her, when called up by Lady Ellersby's
words, and which now again recurred
to her with painful intenseness. A short hour,
however, relieved every one from anxiety;
Lord Melcomb was completely restored, and he
received the embraces of his child: when kissing
away the tears, which she could not restrain,
he entreated her to lay aside all fears
on his account. Once more the bridal pair
received the parental blessing; and taking
leave of the few dear friends that surrounded
them, stepped into their carriage and set off
for Lord Glenmore's villa, where after remaining
a short time, and feeling quite reassured
on Lord Melcomb's account, they
proceeded on a tour to Paris.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 2em;">A FASHIONABLE EASTER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> season was approaching when, in good
old times, the heads of great families left the
metropolis, and in the retirement of their
country seats or villas devoted the precious
hours of the solemn festival of Easter to reflection,
apart from busy scenes of public life in
the bosoms of their families&mdash;thus setting an
example worthy of imitation: and overcoming,
in some degree, the difficulty with which we
know a rich man shall enter the Kingdom of
Heaven.</p>

<p>How widely different is it at the present day
with those who call themselves <i>The Ton</i>. They
go indeed, at this holy season, to villas, and
country seats, but take with them there all the
follies, and vices, and habits of that daily
idleness and dissipation which can suffer no
pause in its riot, no diminution in its intoxication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Ellersby had invited to Restormel
Lady Tilney and the more select of her coterie.
Some there were, the subalterns of their <i>corps
élite</i>, who, however subservient and ready they
had proved themselves to adopt the follies of
exclusiveness, had as yet failed in establishing
themselves in its full rights and prerogatives,
and who, after the sacrifice of their own true
dignity, still found themselves but as tools in
the hands of others. These, often overlooked
in the more <i>recherché</i> amusements, <i>heard</i> of the
party at Restormel, but only <i>heard</i>, and were
not among the invited. To be excluded on
such an occasion was a mortification of the
severest kind, and it became a matter of the
greatest importance to have their names
inserted, if possible, on the select list. To
obtain this point, the infinite pains and
ingenuity employed were worthy of a better
cause. The Baskervilles were of the number
overlooked; and, addressing his wife on the
subject with as much eagerness as it was permitted
one of his dignified refinement to display,
Lord Baskerville said:</p>

<p>"Imagine what Boileau has just told me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Lady Ellersby has a party at Restormel next
week! I do think <i>we</i> had a right to be asked;
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh certainly, <i>love</i>," replied Lady Baskerville,
a sweet-sounding epithet of affection
which but on few occasions passed between
them: "Certainly: and if we are not, I shall
think it quite rude; but <i>I will</i> arrange the
matter."</p>

<p>That night Lady Baskerville went to the
Opera with Lady Boileau; as soon as an opportunity
presented itself, Lady Baskerville
turned suddenly round, and said, "Oh, there
is Lady Ellersby, I see, in her box: how well
she looks&mdash;of <i>course you</i> are going to Restormel
at Easter?" and she kissed her hand the
while, in her most smiling manner, to the lady
of whom she spoke.</p>

<p>"No, I am not invited," replied Lady Boileau.
"Are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," rejoined Lady Baskerville, (determined
to hazard the lie at all events, and trust
to chance, or her own devices, to make it true
afterwards.) "But how very odd she should
have left you out; it must be some mistake."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, it is not a mistake&mdash;it cannot be;
for Lady Ellersby, you know, makes all her
invitations on these occasions <i>de vive voix</i>."
Lady Baskerville almost betrayed herself as
she <i>felt</i> Lady Boileau's penetrating eyes fixed
upon her's, with a scrutiny she did not wish to
prolong; however she rallied dexterously, and
turned off the discourse into some other
channel; but Lady Boileau returned to the
charge, saying:</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Lady Baskerville, as <i>you
are</i> asked, do you not think you could get us
invited also? You know I hardly ever break
my rule of running the risk of compromising a
friend by tormenting her to procure invitations,
but for this once I think I may venture,
considering our long friendship, to entrust you
with the secret (for you know I would not
have it said for the world), that I wish to
be of the number of the <i>Priées</i> to Restormel&mdash;now
as I intend giving my first ball immediately
after Easter, I shall consult her to-night
about certain persons whom I am rather doubtful
whether I shall ask or not, and then by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
appealing to you, throw the conversation into
your hands, and give you an opportunity of
naming those who are invited to Restormel,
which will bring about the subject in such a
natural way, that either I must be asked or
she will commit herself by a rudeness which
she generally avoids."</p>

<p>Lady Baskerville sat on thorns, but during the
length of this speech she had leisure to collect her
scattered senses, and began a reply equally elaborate,
professing herself to be exceedingly attached
and obliged to Lady Boileau, and for <i>that
very reason</i> declining all interference on the present
occasion&mdash;"for you know," she said, "it
makes one so very <i>nervous</i> to put a friend under
the unpleasant predicament of being refused.
Besides, the moment one lets the world know
that one has a friend who wants any thing,
people begin immediately to conclude that
they may want many things, and directly look
shy, and make an excuse, and get off, and
probably cut both the <i>asker</i> and the person for
whom they ask. However <i>you know</i> I will do
what <i>I can do</i>, but only I entreat you will leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
me at liberty to chuse the mode of managing
this business."</p>

<p>"Yes," rejoined Lady Boileau, "most certainly;
but perhaps the best way of all will be
to say nothing about it, beforehand, and then
for me to arrive unexpectedly, and say <i>you</i> had
asked me, and had forgotten to mention to
Lady Ellersby that you had done so."</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>not for the world</i>, my dearest Lady
Boileau, not for the world,&mdash;besides,&mdash;I just
recollect&mdash;Lord Baskerville had some idea we
should not go at all;"&mdash;at that instant arrives
Lord Baskerville himself, and forgetting his
acquired manner, he opened the box-door
somewhat abruptly, and in his natural gay
agreeable way, such as is his own when he
ceases to remember he is an exclusive, he said,
addressing Lady Baskerville,</p>

<p>"I have this instant had an invitation for you,
which I am sure you will accept with pleasure:
it is from Lady Ellersby to go to Restormel."</p>

<p>"Dear! la! Lord Baskerville, how odd
you are&mdash;that is so like you&mdash;to have forgot&mdash;and
Lady Ellersby too, she must have forgotten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
don't you know <i>we were</i> asked a fortnight
ago."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;hem! very true," and taking the
hint which Lady Baskerville had given him
by an expressive glance, "hem! I <i>had</i> really
forgotten, I always forget <i>those sort of things</i>,
hem!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and you said then, <i>if you</i> remember,
that <i>you</i> would not go, for that you thought of
visiting Tunbridge, as you always conceived
Restormel to be a dull, damp place, and so
unwholesome, with its quantity of trees and
stagnant water."</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;so I did,&mdash;hem! very true, and so it
is, and now you put me in mind, I rather
suppose <i>we</i>, that is <i>I</i>, shall not go, for of
course <i>your</i> ladyship will do as you chuse."</p>

<p>Lady Boileau, though young in years, was
too old a bird of fashion to be caught with chaff,
she saw through this matrimonial man&#339;uvre,
but was too prudent to let her perception be
seen; and in regard to Lady Baskerville's
refusal on the subject of Restormel, she
pretended to take it as the latter intended
it should be taken, and her outward appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
remained unruffled, but at the same time
it was marked in the tablets of her memory, as
a token of friendship <i>not to be forgotten</i>.</p>

<p>"Indeed," replied Lady Boileau, in answer
to Lord Baskerville's last remark, "you are
both quite right, Restormel <i>is</i> a <i>dull</i> place, and
I advise you to secure a party for Tunbridge,
in which I shall be most happy to join you."</p>

<p>"I will think about it, hem!" replied Lord
Baskerville, "and consult the Comtesse Leinsengen,"
and thus he bowed out of the box.
Shortly after, Lady Baskerville feigned a very
bad head-ache and retired before the end of
the ballet. Not so Lady Boileau; she watched
Lady Ellersby's movements, and contrived to
meet her in the room just at the very moment
when the crowd prevented her escaping.</p>

<p>"What do you think I have been doing all
night?" Lady Boileau asked?</p>

<p>"Not listening to the Opera," replied Mr.
Spencer Newcomb, who was handing Lady
Ellersby.</p>

<p>"As if any body ever really came to attend
to or listen to it!" she observed; "it is the very
last thing one comes to the Opera for," yawning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been much better employed,"
rejoined Lady Boileau, "for I have been
defending the <i>agrémens</i> of Restormel against
Lord and Lady Baskerville's assertion of its
being the dullest place in the world; they
both declared it always gave them the vapours."</p>

<p>"So it does me," replied Lady Ellersby,
again yawning, "and that is precisely the
reason why I take such special care never
to go there, without having it well filled. But
then all places in the country are alike, and
one <i>must</i> go out of town at Easter."</p>

<p>"Well, Lady Ellersby, that may be true
enough: all country places are insufferably
dull except it be to give a fête during the
lilac and laburnum season; but I think
your friends might make some distinction
between <i>you</i> and your <i>place</i>, and as far as
I could observe there was none made by the
Baskervilles."</p>

<p>"Oh was there <i>not</i>, he, he! Oh if such
<i>is</i> the case I am sorry I asked them to-night."</p>

<p>"To-night! did you not make Lady Baskerville
the invitation long before to-night?
you will pardon my asking the question; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
have a particular reason, which I will explain
to you hereafter, for doing so."</p>

<p>"La, dear, no," yawning, "I never thought
of asking any body <i>long ago</i>." This, though
in contradiction to her former declaration of
taking care to <i>secure</i> a party, she was obliged
to say in order to avoid a marked rudeness to
Lady Boileau, "and," she continued, "now
I have the good fortune to meet you, dear
Lady Boileau, will you and Lord Boileau
have the charity to join us; and, notwithstanding
Lady Baskerville's terrific account of
Restormel, venture to come and <i>egayer</i> its
melancholy bowers; at all events it will be
better than remaining in town, and we will try
to do what we can to render ourselves agreeable
to you."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted; we shall have the
greatest pleasure in waiting upon you, and am
certain we shall be extremely well amused."</p>

<p>The great object of Lady Boileau's day was
now successfully attained, and doubtless she
laid her head upon her pillow that night with
all the satisfaction which such success ought to
confer. Lady Baskerville, on her part rejoiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
in having as she thought so completely outman&#339;uvred
her friend, and enjoyed the triumph
which her superior skill in the management of
such matters, as well as her superior knowledge
of <i>the world</i>, had afforded her. Yet these
women called each other <i>friends</i>! How is that
sacred name profaned, that name which can
have no embodied existence, but with the
sincere and good, yet which is polluted in the
world's mouth at every instant.</p>

<p>Restormel was, as it had been described
by Lady Baskerville, an exceedingly gloomy
place, but all within the house was luxury;
beyond its walls, however, there were none of
those moral circumstances which can give
interest even to the dullest spot. The scenery
was monotonous and insipid; but there might
have been an enlivening character thrown
over the gloom, in the happy countenances
and cheerful looks of dependents and retainers,
if such had been the will of the
possessors of Restormel. But this was not
the case, the cold calculating system of employment
of the poor, merely when the purpose
of keeping up the grounds or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
improvements made it necessary, and then
taking no further charge whatever of the
beings so employed, regarding them only as
the labourers of the hour, conspired to give
the place a moral, as well as a natural gloom.</p>

<p>No peasant's abode in these domains was
ever cheered by Lady Ellersby's presence; no
sufferer in sickness or distress alleviated beyond
the donation of money, and that but seldom;&mdash;none
of those heart-interests in short were
ever evinced, on her, or her Lord's part, which
confer a mutual delight on those who receive,
and on those who bestow them, and which
maintain that link between the higher and
lower classes, which is at once so beautiful
and so beneficial, and without which all the
luxuries in the world will never produce any
thing but a melancholy and unsatisfying
grandeur.</p>

<p>There certainly, however, were the means,
if they had been resorted to, for every laudable
gratification of interest and entertainment
at Restormel. And where is the country
place in which, if its possessor fulfil the
various duties the possession entails on him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the means are wanting; and even as it was,
if that sickly appetite for excitement which
characterised its present inhabitants could
ever have been satisfied, it must have been
here, where every thing connected with their
system of life was found in profusion; but
the factitious smiles which gild the exterior
of such a circle as was generally to be met with
at Restormel is not the sunshine of real happiness.</p>

<p>Easter was now arrived and the party
assembled at Restormel, consisted of the
Tilneys, the Tenderdens, the Baskervilles,
the Leinsengens, Luttermannes, Lord Tonnerre,
Lady Hamlet Vernon, Lord Albert
D'Esterre (who was asked <i>on trial</i>), Lord and
Lady Boileau, by the man&#339;uvre which has
been described, and one or two single men
like Mr. Leslie Winyard, Mr. Spencer Newcomb,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>These persons all met on the first night of
their arrival at an eight o'clock dinner. Lord
Albert D'Esterre had been invited at Lady
Tilney's suggestion, who considered a country
house a good stage for the display of a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
<i>debutant</i>, and as affording no unpropitious
opportunity of forwarding her wishes in regard
to Lord Albert's political bias. These wishes,
however, were soon doomed to disappointment;
Lord Albert had accepted the invitation under
the impression that in the country there was
more leisure and tranquillity than the hurry of
a London life allowed; but whether in the
country or town, he might have known, had
not the fatal mist of delusion which comes over
all who enter on a tortuous path began to
blind him, that reflection and serenity of mind
do not depend on time or place; that power,
that calm, may be destroyed or may be
nurtured in cities, as in lonely wilds, it is true;
but had he thought for a moment, he would
have felt that the gay assemblage in which he
was to mix at Restormel, was not calculated to
restore him to that state of mind which he
believed himself anxious to regain.</p>

<p>In the course of Lord Albert D'Esterre's
acquaintance with Lady Hamlet Vernon, he
had discovered much to charm, to dazzle, and
to lead a mind so young as his into a maze
of error. Sophistry had gradually drawn its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
veil before his perception of truth; through this
he viewed her character; and under the same
delusive influence, he persuaded himself that
the interest he took in her arose from the
purest motive, namely that of endeavouring to
free from error, one whose nature was naturally
endowed with capabilities for becoming
truly estimable. He listened to all her dangerous
and seductive opinions, while he gazed on
her beauty, bewildered with the false conviction
that he did so to prove to her the error
of the one, and to point out the peril which,
with such unfixed tenets, the other would
most probably lead her into.</p>

<p>What a melancholy prospect, he inwardly
exclaimed, lies before that beautiful creature,
whose principles have never been formed to
virtue, and who has been cast among those
whose every axiom is contrary to the laws of
purity and truth! What delight in the reflection,
what a good action it will be, to disentangle
such a being from the snares that
surround her, and restore her to a life of usefulness
and happiness. My heart aches for
her, when I think how in early youth, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
she could know her own wishes, she was
married to an unprincipled husband, one who
could never have known her worth; she must not
be abandoned without an effort to save her.
Thus did Lord Albert parley with himself,
till a dangerous admixture of evil glided in with
his better feelings, and prevented that clear
perception between right and wrong, which
under his engagements should have made him
at once fly from Lady Hamlet Vernon. It
was <i>not</i> so, however, and Lady Hamlet Vernon
was more the object that led him to Restormel,
than any wish for, or sense of, the necessity of
retirement and reflection.</p>

<p>The mode of living at Restormel was what
Spencer Newcomb wittily called the <i>foreign
system</i>, that is, every pleasure-giving circumstance
was throughout the daily routine cultivated
to the utmost point which art could reach.
To give an account of it in detail would be a
work of supererogation; for it was a transfer
of London to the country, only with this difference,
that the post town and high road took
place of the streets of the metropolis; and the
shrubberies and gardens of Restormel, of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of Kensington and the Park; with the exception,
too, of a rather animated discussion between
Lady Tilney and Lord Tonnerre on
the subject of female influence; and which
brought the parties into closer collision, than
was consistent with the outward harmony of
exclusive <i>ton</i>.</p>

<p>Little occurred during the first few days of
the retreat to Restormel to vary the monotony
of the scene. With reference to this latter
subject, Lady Tilney remarked to Lady Baskerville,
as they left the dining-room, on the
evening when the affair alluded to had taken
place, "I am very sorry, my dear Lady
Baskerville, very sorry indeed, that what I said
should have taken such a desperate effect on
your friend Lord Tonnerre; however, it does
every body good to hear the truth now and
then, and as he seldom if ever hears it, I
think I have done him service in sounding that
tocsin in his ears for once in his life, don't you,
my dear?"</p>

<p>"He, he, he!" tittered Lady Baskerville,
who did not like to offend the speaker, though
she was really angry with her in her heart;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
"I dare say you are quite right&mdash;but for my
part, I never wish to teach any body any thing;
I was so tired of being taught myself, that
whatever reminds me of the dull days of being
a good girl, and having a governess, quite overcomes
me."</p>

<p>"Oh," observed the Comtesse Leinsengen,
"what sinnify, whether dat Lord is in a passion
or not, nothing will ever change him.
He knows but two phrases in the dictionary,
<i>I will</i> and <i>I won't</i>, you <i>shall</i> and you <i>shan't</i>,
and he do tink himself, and all dat belong to
himself, quite perfect, <i>c'est une ignorance crasse
a tout prendre</i>, but what <i>sinnify</i> it? He was
alway Milor Tonnerre, he <i>is</i> Milor Tonnerre,
he will alway <i>be</i> Milor Tonnerre; <i>laisser le
grogner, c'est son métier; en qualité de Tonnerre
il grognera toujours, quesque ça nous fait?
il n'est pas notre mari laisse-le là de grâces</i>,"
and she looked at Lady Baskerville as she
spoke.</p>

<p>This affair, however, did not pass over quite
so easily as Lady Tilney would have had it;
and it ended in Lord Tonnerre's going suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
to town; and Lady Baskerville remaining in
exceedingly bad humour: for to be without an
<i>attaché quelconque</i> was as bad as to be without
a hat from Herbot's.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 2em;">FASCINATION&mdash;THE CHURCH-YARD, &amp;c.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a continued scene of frivolity, to call it by
no harsher name, and in the turmoil of petty
passions and jarring female interests, passed
the hours at Restormel that led on to the most
solemn period of the year. Amongst the actors
in it, Lord Albert D'Esterre cannot (with the
feelings and character which he still possessed)
be supposed to have held a part at all consistent
with his true wishes; and, but for the increasing
and alarming fascination of his senses,
and the warping of his better judgment, by
the influence which Lady Hamlet Vernon
still, day by day, more effectually exercised
over him, he would have quitted a society
altogether, of which he could never really
form a component part, and <i>from</i> which, but
for the third power which held him in combination
with it, he must have quickly separated
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>But, however much this fatal influence might
affect the general line of his conduct, the good
seeds sown in early life, though sadly choaked
as they had been, were not yet totally eradicated;
and on the morning of the Easter
festival, he took his way to the village to obey
the calling bell of church. The service
had begun when he entered, and it was not
till the first lesson was commenced that he
lifted his eyes from the book, and beheld in
the family pew opposite Lady Hamlet Vernon.
A flush of various feelings coloured his cheek,
and suffused with a richer glow even the
whiteness of his forehead. She is then, he
thought, in despite of the example around
her, really good;&mdash;she has listened to my
advice; she has come to the fountain-head for
instruction&mdash;all is well! He then endeavoured
to follow the service throughout its solemn
beauty; but his mind was disturbed, and his
thoughts wandered.</p>

<p>When the congregation was dismissed, of
course he bowed and approached Lady Hamlet
Vernon with the greetings of the morning
salutations, and offering her his arm, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
walked slowly on into the church-yard; it
was one of those quiet gray days, which belong
neither to winter nor spring, but owned affinity
with both, and there was a freshness in the
odour of the new trodden grass, which might
have been deemed the precursor of flowers,
had not a frosty air chilled the sweet promise;&mdash;some
fine old yews surrounded the church-yard,
and the gay colours of the country
peoples' ribbons and cloaks appeared in brilliant
relief as they lingered beneath the dark
boughs.</p>

<p>The rustic curtsey, and abrupt inclination
of respect, which were offered in homage to
Lord D'Esterre and Lady Hamlet Vernon on
either side, as they passed through the village
throng, indicated that the actions of those in
the higher ranks of life can never be disregarded
by the lower; a kind of deep respect,
and an apparent satisfaction, sat on the
countenances of these good people, and they
showed by their very looks and manner, that
they felt the hallowing of the sabbath to be a
link of sympathy existing between them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
their superiors, which mutually allied them in
the bonds of christian fellowship.</p>

<p>These are feelings which, even in the uneducated,
are still indigenous to the human heart,
and, if cherished and preserved, become as
productive of good as, when neglected or contemned,
they tend to incalculable evil. As
Lord Albert and Lady Hamlet Vernon passed
along, the latter observed:</p>

<p>"I love to linger here; these rude memorials
of love and respect to the dead" (pointing to
the graves at their feet) "are a mournful gratification
to the living; they tell us that in our
turn we may at least hope to remain some short
time in the memories of those whom we quit;
but after all, <i>tout passe</i>," and she sighed
heavily;&mdash;"yes, <i>here</i> undoubtedly all that the
proudest trophies can do, is for a time to point
the moral of a good or bad character by the
stone that covers or decorates the tomb."</p>

<p>"But the tomb, dear Lady Hamlet, is only
the repository of the dust; it will itself become
like the dust it covers; but never, like that
awakened dust, be infused with new life, a
life far more glorious than all that we can form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
an idea of; and we must look not <i>upon</i>, not
<i>in</i> the grave, but beyond it, where death is
swallowed up in victory."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> can do this, and you are happy," she
replied. A cold revulsion struck on Lord
Albert's heart as she paused and breathed with
labouring breath,&mdash;"and can <i>you</i> not do so?"
he asked in deep low tone and shuddered as
he spoke. She shook her head; and after a
moment's pause said, "all the happiness I
know is confined to a few brief moments&mdash;a few
electric gleams of pleasure, which vanish in
their birth; a feverish uncertain and fearful
catching at delight, which yet eludes my grasp.
These are all the means which I possess to
obtain happiness; yet, such as they are, and
such as my success in them is, I would not
exchange them for yours&mdash;what! exchange
your cold, leaden, measured <i>theories of feelings</i>,
for they are nothing more&mdash;or the beating
pulse of spontaneous joy, which even in this
moment of our communing is mine; no,
Lord Albert, no&mdash;meanly as I think of myself
when measured by your standard in the
general tenour of our existence, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
scale of being, there are moments when I soar
above all that was ever dreamt of in your
philosophy,"&mdash;and as she spoke her eyes danced
in a deceptive brilliancy that for the moment
turned Lord Albert's brain. He shuddered as
he felt the pressure of her arm on his while she
uttered these words, and his uncertain footsteps
slid upon the base of a marble tomb.</p>

<p>In the action of recovering himself, a kind of
change seemed to pass through his frame; so
much are we influenced by trivial circumstances,
which yet are surely not the agents of
chance; in so doing his eyes rested on an inscription
engraven on the stone, and as if glad
to escape from answering her, he read the
following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They were so one, it never could be said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which of them ruled, or which of them obeyed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ruled because she would obey, and she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By him obeying, ruled as well as he.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There ne'er was known betwixt them a dispute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save which the other's will should execute.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The lines are indeed beautiful," said Lady
Hamlet Vernon, "and I could be content to be
the mould under that stone, if I had ever
enjoyed an existence to which they might with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
truth have been applied&mdash;but as it is, <i>non
ragionam di lor</i>;" and she sprang lightly
forwards, adding in a tone of affected levity,
"let us make haste back to Restormel;
why, dear Lord Albert, we shall be laughed at
if it is known that we have been to church."
The spell was broken, he made no reply, and
they continued the remainder of their walk in
silence.</p>

<p>"Hard, cold, insensate man!" cried Lady
Hamlet Vernon, when she reached her own
apartment; "but he shall be met with an equal
share of self-love. I will subdue this haughty
nature, and mock at him, when his hour of
suffering arrives. If he loved passionately
any thing, even that doll, that infant, that
piece of clock-work Lady Adeline Seymour, I
could forgive him; but he does not, it is a systematical
pursuit of an ideal perfection, that
leaves his heart always cold and untouched,
and fenced round as it were with adamant.
Proud D'Esterre, thou shalt weep for this"&mdash;and
she paused for a moment, then collecting all
her thoughts, her final resolution was taken,
and availing herself of a communication which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
she had to make to Mr. Foley, who she trusted
might be instrumental to her purpose, with a
breaking heart, and with contending feelings
she seized a pen, and traced the following
letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am happy to inform you, my dear Mr.
Foley, that the official patronage, which you
have long wished me to procure for you, is
now actually obtained, and your arrival in town
is all that is wanted to arrange the necessary
preliminaries. A letter received yesterday informs
me of this; but in the interim, I wish
you could make it convenient to pass a few
days here on your road to London; for between
ourselves, this place and its society is
insufferably dull; and were it not for tilt and
tournament between Lord Tonnerre and Lady
Tilney (who you know under the rose cannot
hear each other,) we must have all gone to
sleep, or torn one another to pieces, or eaten
our own paws, like antediluvian hyenas, from
the absolute want of mental nourishment. But
in this predicament, resembling people reduced
to starvation on a sea voyage, we cast lots to
see who should first be sacrificed for the benefit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of the rest, and fortunately by the address
of Lady Tilney, the lot was made to fall on
Lord Tonnerre, who finished his existence
amongst us, as he always lived, in a storm of
passion; the only one of the party, I believe,
who regrets his absence, is Lady Baskerville,
who is now <i>sans cavalier</i>, and in the Roman
phraseology, <i>d'impeccarsi</i>. I advise you then
by all means to come quickly, and to supply
the vacancy.</p>

<p>"But to leave joking, I must tell you my
dear friend, that I languish for a rational companion,
and one who will kindly enter into
my feelings; nobody understands me here;&mdash;too
good, and too bad, I am like Mahomet's
tomb, hanging between heaven and earth, and
I find no resting place for my sick soul, nor
shall I, 'till you come with your kindly smile,
to solace my weary spirit. Come, therefore,
and that without delay, for you well know that
when any thing is to be done, it had best be
done quickly&mdash;all delays are dangerous, and
with me they are despair.</p>

<p>"Would you wish to know something of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
those you will meet here? I have only to mention
their names, and refer you to our old note
book; I see no great visible change in any of
them. Mr. Spencer Newcombe has been here
for a few days, and is certainly the <i>most</i> diverting
man in the world; and well he may be, for
he lives entirely for that purpose.</p>

<p>"Lord Albert D'Esterre is here also; he
sets up for a censor and corrector of men,
manners, and things. He will have enough
to do, if he persists in this unpopular walk;
but I am much mistaken, if he will not soon
find it a very arduous undertaking, and one
indeed which is quite hopeless. If he were
but content to do as other people do, who live
in the world, and to be a little more like his
day and generation, and a little less of Don
Quixotte, he would really be a pleasant person.
He does not, <i>par parenthèse</i>, seem in a
hurry to join his betrothed, which I think is
rather a good sign; for I should have but a
poor opinion of a man who did as papa and
mamma ordered, and fell in love precisely as
he had been desired to do in the days of his
childhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Tilney, the Leinsengen, the Baskerville,
the Boileau, go on in their usual way;
and like the old quotation, though they all
differ, yet they all agree in one thing at least,
which is wishing the society of your agreeable
self; so under pain of not only my displeasure,
but that of all the world's, come quickly,
and delay not. Adieu, and believe me to be
the most true of your true friends.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 1em;">"H. V."</p></blockquote>

<p>In consequence of the occurrence of Lord
Albert's morning walk, he felt little inclined
to join the circle on his return to Restormel;
and was in a mood too replete with contradictory
feelings, to allow him to reflect calmly,
still less to enable him to decide sanely upon
the only vigorous step he should have taken,
namely, to flee from temptation. He excused
himself under the plea of being unwell, from
leaving his own room; and sitting down with a
determination of communing with his own
heart, he found not the habit so easy, after
long neglect; and was conscious that he
mused, without deriving any fruit from his
contemplations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>But by degrees, this confusion of mind
subsided; and then came that soothing composure,
which, after a state of emotion, is always
welcomed with something like pleasure.
He opened a favourite author, Owen Feltham;
and he could not read long, without seeing his
own necessities reflected in the page, as in a
glass; this is one way by which to prove
whether a moral or religious work be sterling
or not, does it apply to our necessities? does it
first probe, and then salve our wounds? Lord
Albert D'Esterre found this book did both; and
in its perusal, there was a sanctity of enjoyment
to which he had been long a stranger. This
enjoyment was, however, too soon disturbed by
his servant bringing in a note; he felt it as an
unwelcome intrusion; but it was opened after
a moment's hesitation, and contained the following
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am anxious to know how you really are.
I too am unwell, and I dread lest I should
have have said or done something this morning,
which may have offended you&mdash;oh! if
you know how terrible it is for those who
have none to care for them, to suppose for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
instant that they have given pain (however,
unwittingly) to the only person whose good
opinion they are anxious to possess, and who
has evinced an interest in their welfare&mdash;you
would now feel for me. I am not of those
who make a display of their heart's feelings&mdash;far
from it, I am a miser of the few treasures
which lie hoarded there; it is for that reason
that I mingle with the rest, as though
I were one of <i>them</i>; and that I am now writing
these troubled lines in the midst of the insipid
turmoil which surrounds me; <i>tout comme si de
rien étoit</i>. Aid me in bearing my grievous
burthen of existence, and send me one line
to be a cordial for the moment at least; the
present moment's ease is all I ever hope for."</p></blockquote>

<p>What an overturn to all composure was
conveyed in this little bit of perfumed paper;
fifty commencements of reply were made and
torn; at last he rang his bell, summoned his
valet, and having given a verbal answer to the
effect that he would shortly obey the commands
of Lady Hamlet Vernon, he appeared
in the drawing-room almost as soon as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
could have expected a written reply. She was
sitting apart from the rest of the company
with a look of abstractedness and melancholy,
the effect of which was heightened by extreme
paleness; her beautiful dark hair was less carefully
arranged than the laws of fashion demanded,
but it was not the less beautiful for
that, and some stray tresses fell gracefully
upon her neck; her air, her dress, the subdued
expression of her eyes, were all captivating,
and precisely in Lord Albert's <i>own</i> way.</p>

<p>There was a carelessness or scorn of <i>fashionable</i>
dress, which particularly suited his
theories on the subject, not that his practical
admiration had not fifty times been excited by
a very different mode of attire; for the fact
is, that men's tastes in respect to the costume
of women are always regulated by that of the
person they are in love with. On this occasion,
however, it is certain that Lady Hamlet's
attire was in the letter and in the spirit precisely
what Lord Albert D'Esterre pronounced
perfect. She held out her hand to him as he
entered the saloon with the composed air of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
friendship, and expressed her pleasure at seeing
him, for she had feared his indisposition
would not have allowed him to leave his room:
and then motioning him to sit down by her
with that expression of calm interest, which
attracts without affording any plausible application
of the sentiment to a more vivid interest,
she secured her object, and he occupied
the vacant seat next to her's. Mr. Leslie Winyard,
who was playing <i>écarté</i> (even on the sacred
day) with Lady Boileau, while the rest were
studying and betting on the game, called to
Lord D'Esterre, "ah! Lord Albert, we have
all been guessing the reason of your absence;
one said writing letters of love, another sleeping;
but the successful guess was given to my
penetrating judgment, writing a sermon on
the vanities of human life, that is, holding
up to censure all that we your friends are
doing."</p>

<p>"I assure you, Mr. Leslie Winyard, that
you have not proved your judgment infallible;
for I do not plead guilty either to <i>your</i> charge,
or to any of the others."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, join in our game; Lady Boileau
intends to beat me, and I'll vacate my
seat in your favour, and, in parliamentary
phrase, accept at the same time as many hundreds
as you may choose to give me."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Lord Albert, "I cannot."</p>

<p>"Did you suppose Lady Hamlet Vernon
would let him do so?" whispered Lady Baskerville.</p>

<p>"That may be," replied Leslie Winyard,
"but my life for it that is not his reason, he
will not play because it is Sunday."</p>

<p>"Sunday, is it?" yawned Lady Ellersby;
"dear me! I did not know it was Sunday."</p>

<p>"Leslie Winyard declares you will not play
because it is Sunday, Lord Albert D'Esterre,"
exclaimed Mr. Spencer Newcomb.</p>

<p>"Whatever may be my motive, or my
fancy for not playing," replied Lord Albert,
"I conceive that it is at variance with the
high good breeding of this circle to inquire
further into the matter, though, if it will afford
any satisfaction to Mr. Leslie Winyard, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
not the smallest hesitation to give to him
those motives."</p>

<p>"I am bounden to you, my Lord," rejoined
the latter, putting his hand to his heart, "but
for the moment waive the honour of hearing
more, being at the very crisis of the game,"
and so saying he turned to the card-table, and
left Lord D'Esterre to the undisturbed enjoyment
of his conversation with Lady Hamlet
Vernon.</p>

<p>She first broke silence (speaking in a low
tone). "How many misnomers there are in the
world; this society considers itself the mode
and paragon of manners and of fashion&mdash;the
world <i>par excellence</i>; and yet the members of it
are always doing or saying something to offend
the feelings of each other. Why was a being
like myself thrown amongst them? one who
sees their falsehood and folly, and yet cannot
escape from it. But on the contrary, every
day as it passes seems more and more to entangle
me. I possess indeed one friend, from
whom I look for consolation; but <i>he</i>, like every
one in this world, has his own troubles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
indeed I have sometimes feared, that is I fear"&mdash;she
broke off abruptly as if to find a suitable
expression for what she would say, then again
continued after a pause&mdash;"that I did not altogether
act a generous part by him; one may
excite a deeper interest than one intends, for
it is so soothing to a desolate heart, to find any
one whom it can like, and rest upon, that it is
easy to be betrayed into a conduct, that would
afterwards perhaps render one obnoxious to
the imputation of coquetry; the character for
which of all others, I have the most decided
contempt. I have not yet learnt from you, Lord
Albert D'Esterre," laying particular emphasis
on her words, "that firm independence of
mind, which never yields under circumstances;
for whatever vain disputation I may hold with
myself, I find I am continually yielding to the
influence of events, and floating down the tide
of life, guided more by impulse, than by principle.
It will perhaps be as well in the end&mdash;who
knows?"</p>

<p>Lord Albert D'Esterre had listened with
evident pain to the sophistry these words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
contained, and as Lady Hamlet Vernon paused,
added in his most impressive manner:</p>

<p>"Oh! dear Lady Hamlet Vernon, I fear
it will undoubtedly <i>not</i> be well with us in the
end, if we live by chance; and we may all
know, if we chuse to know, that so to live will
prove our condemnation."</p>

<p>"Persuade me of <i>that</i>, teach me your knowledge,
and I will act upon it; give me your
conviction and I will bless you."</p>

<p>"Surely," thought Lord Albert D'Esterre,
"it is my duty to reclaim this person from the
unhappy and destructive errors into which she
has fallen; it would be altogether wrong, it would
be barbarous, to abandon one, who calls upon
me for aid, who appeals to <i>me</i> for instruction."
Not but another view of the subject crossed
his mind, for thoughts, as we all know, flow in
from contradictory sources.</p>

<p>"Surely the friend to whom you allude,
and on whom you say you rely, will be a far
more able instructor than I can be."</p>

<p>"Ay, so he might (she replied) if"&mdash;&mdash;"If
what?"&mdash;&mdash;"If I durst on all occasions apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
to him&mdash;but&mdash;but there are existing reasons
to which I before alluded, and which I now
frankly tell you, have frequently made me deny
myself the consolation of his society. We shall
see how things are now, when we are to meet
again after a long absence."</p>

<p>Lord Albert D'Esterre could scarcely misunderstand
the meaning which these words implied,
and he was too delicate to press the matter
further; but when they separated for the
night, the chief point which was impressed on
Lord Albert's mind was, that Lady Hamlet
Vernon was beloved by Mr. Foley, and if she
did not positively return that sentiment in its
full degree, that she owned a preference in his
favour, to which it was very nearly allied. Yet
if it were so, why should that circumstance
cause him uneasiness? It could only be from
the interest he had imbibed for a person, who
seemed intended for a higher and better career
than the one she was pursuing.</p>

<p>Men, even the very best of men, frequently
deceive themselves on similar occasions; they
are not, perhaps, <i>in love</i>, they do not mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
to be so; still less is it their intention deliberately
to awaken an interest which they feel
they cannot return: but though they are few,
who would attempt to <i>win</i> a heart under these
circumstances, and merely for the triumph of
doing so; <i>all</i> are not sufficiently free from vanity
to <i>refuse</i> one, when spontaneously offered,
nor, while its possession can be valued for the
passing gratification of self-love <i>only</i>, voluntarily
forego the distinction which its homage
affords. That such was the predicament in
which Lord Albert D'Esterre stood, or that
such was the train of his thoughts, it would be
difficult to say.</p>

<p>Lady Hamlet Vernon's conduct and manners
towards himself certainly betrayed partiality,
which it was impossible to avoid seeing;
but it was equally impossible to attach to them
the decided character of love; and even were
it so, Lord Albert stood pledged to an engagement
of the most sacred nature, and one
which had it been intimated to him he could
have abandoned, he would have started from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the contemplation of its possibility; still, however,
his mind was under delusion in regard
to Lady Hamlet Vernon, and the interest which
he would have persuaded himself was felt for
her sake only, was, it is to be feared, nearly allied
to a sentiment, which in his circumstances
never should have been entertained.</p>

<p>If, however, Lord Albert D'Esterre was
wandering in the maze of undefined resolution,
and with an uncertainty of object, in all
his speculations, not so Lady Hamlet Vernon,
who well marked the nature of the interest
she was gradually acquiring over him,
and which she hoped soon to see augmented
in a degree which would render him completely
her own.</p>

<p>Many days did not elapse from this time
before Mr. Foley arrived. With that refinement
of tact which all women understand so
well, Lady Hamlet Vernon made her first approach
towards the object she had in view,
by producing between Mr. Foley and Lord
Albert D'Esterre a mutual partiality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>She effected this, as is often successfully done,
by repeating favourable opinions respecting
each, which were uttered, or were not uttered,
as it chanced by the parties one of another;
"<i>mais on ne s'avise jamais de tout</i>," and there
was one circumstance which operated against
her wishes whilst cementing their intimacy.
Thus was the influence which Mr. Foley's vivid
description and praises of the attractions of
Lady Adeline Seymour produced on Lord
Albert D'Esterre's mind. Although somewhat
diminished by absence and by the too
great security he felt of conceiving her
to be beyond the possibility of change, these
attractions still retained their power, and it
needed but the description which he more
than once listened to of her beauty and her
worth, as the theme was dwelt upon by Mr.
Foley, to revive in him all the latent feelings
of his love and admiration for her. After this
revival of the natural allegiance of his heart,
Lord Albert D'Esterre started from his wayward
dream as though he had been warned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
his better angel. Shaking off the listless unaccountable
thraldom which had of late palsied
his resolution, he ordered post-horses, and
determined to set off for Dunmelraise the very
next day.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
